<seg id="2">	A shark attacked and injured a 13-year-old Saturday while diving for lobster in California on the opening day of lobster season, officials said.
<seg id="3">	The attack occurred just before 7 a.m. near Beacon's Beach in Encinitas.
<seg id="4">	Chad Hammel told KSWB-TV in San Diego he had been diving with friends for about half an hour Saturday morning when he heard the girl screaming for help and then paddled over with a group to help pull her out of the water.
<seg id="5">	Hammel said at first he thought it was just excitement of catching a lobster, but then he "realized that she was yelling, 'I got bit! I got bit!'
<seg id="6">	The whole clavicle was ripped open," Hammel said he noticed once he got to the girl.
<seg id="7">	"I yelled at everyone to get out of the water: 'There's a shark in the water!'" Hammel added.
<seg id="8">	The girl was airlifted to Rady Children's Hospital in San Diego where she is listed in critical condition.
<seg id="9">	The species of shark responsible for the attack was unknown.
<seg id="10">	Lifeguard Capt. Mary Giles said at a media briefing that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier, but it was determined not to be a dangerous species of shark.
<seg id="11">	Capt. Giles added the 13-year-old sustained traumatic injuries to the upper torso area.
<seg id="12">	Officials shut down beach access from Ponto Beach in Casablad to Swami's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for investigation and safety purposes.
<seg id="13">	Giles noted that there are more than 135 shark species in the area, but most are not considered dangerous.

<seg id="1">	Ocasio-Cortez delivers powerful speech after Republican's sexist remarks
<seg id="2">	Congressperson condemned ‘violent language against women’ after Ted Yoho berated Ocasio-Cortez on the House steps on Monday
<seg id="3">	Congressperson Ocasio-Cortez’s outrage over a Republican lawmaker’s verbal assault broadened into an extraordinary moment on the House floor on Thursday as she and other Democrats assailed a sexist culture of “accepting violence and violent language against women” whose adherents include Donald Trump.
<seg id="4">	A day after rejecting an offer of contrition from Republican congressperson Ted Yoho for his language during this week’s Capitol steps confrontation, Ocasio-Cortez and more than a dozen colleagues cast the incident as all-too-common behavior by men, including the president and other Republicans.
<seg id="5">	“This issue is not about one incident. It is cultural,” said the congressperson.
<seg id="6">	She called it a culture “of accepting a violence and violent language against women, an entire structure of power that supports that”.
<seg id="7">	The remarkable outpouring, with several female lawmakers saying they had routinely encountered such treatment, came in an election year in which polls show women lean decisively against Trump, who has a history of mocking women.
<seg id="8">	Trump was captured in a 2005 tape boasting about physically abusing them, and his disparagement of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has included calling her “crazy”.
<seg id="9">	The lawmakers joining Ocasio-Cortez represented a wide range of the chamber’s Democrats, underscoring the party’s unity over an issue that can energize their party’s voters.
<seg id="10">	No Republicans spoke.
<seg id="11">	But the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, at a separate appearance defended Yoho, 65, one of his party’s most conservative members and who will retire in January.
<seg id="12">	“When someone apologizes they should be forgiven,” McCarthy said.
<seg id="13">	He added later: “I just think in a new world, in a new age, we now determine whether we accept when someone says I’m sorry if it’s a good enough apology.”
<seg id="14">	Pelosi herself weighed in during a separate news conference.
<seg id="15">	“It’s a manifestation of attitude in our society really.
<seg id="16">	You should be more agreeable.
<seg id="17">	You should be quieter.
<seg id="18">	That's what they tell us.
<seg id="19">	I can tell you that first-hand, they’ve called me names for at least 20 years of leadership, 18 years of leadership,” Pelosi said of Republicans.
<seg id="20">	Pelosi, who has five children, recounted that during a debate years ago on women’s reproductive health, GOP lawmakers “said, on the floor of the House, Nancy Pelosi think she knows more about having babies than the pope”.
<seg id="21">	In an encounter on Monday witnessed by a reporter from the Hill, Yoho berated Ocasio-Cortez on the House steps for saying that some of the increased crime during the coronavirus pandemic could be traced to rising unemployment and poverty.
<seg id="22">	Ocasio-Cortez, a freshman who has made a mark as one of Congress’s most outspoken progressives, described it on the House floor on Thursday.
<seg id="23">	She said Yoho put his finger in her face and called her disgusting, crazy and dangerous.
<seg id="24">	She also told the House that in front of reporters, he called her, “and I quote, ‘a fucking bitch’”.
<seg id="25">	That matched the Hill’s version of what Yoho had said.
<seg id="26">	Ocasio-Cortez was not there for that remark.
<seg id="27">	Ocasio-Cortez said Yoho’s references to his wife and daughters as he explained his actions during brief remarks on Wednesday actually underscored the problem.
<seg id="28">	“Having a daughter does not make a man decent.
<seg id="29">	Having a wife does not make a decent man.
<seg id="30">	Treating people with dignity and respect makes a decent man,” she said.
<seg id="31">	She added that a decent man apologizes “not to save face, not to win a vote.
<seg id="32">	He apologizes, and genuinely, to repair and acknowledge the harm done, so that we can all move on.”

<seg id="2">	The FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Betty Kavanaugh has delayed a final vote on her nomination to the Supreme Court by at least a week, and raises the question of whether the bureau's findings could sway any Republican senators into pulling their support.
<seg id="3">	In an interview airing Sunday, "60 Minutes" correspondent Scott Pelley asked Republicans Sens. Kennedy and Graham whether the FBI could unearth anything that would lead them to change their minds.
<seg id="4">	Kennedy appeared more open than the colleague from South Carolina.
<seg id="5">	"I mean, of course," said Kennedy.
<seg id="6">	"I said going into the hearing, I said, I've talked to Judge Kavanaugh.

<seg id="1">	Labour is no longer a broad church.
<seg id="2">	It is intolerant of those who speak their minds
<seg id="3">	When Momentum's activists in my local party voted to censure me, it was hardly a surprise.
<seg id="4">	After all, I'm the latest in a line of Labour MPs to be told we are not welcome - all for speaking our minds.
<seg id="5">	My parliamentary colleague Joan Ryan received similar treatment because she resolutely stood up to antisemitism.
<seg id="6">	In my case, the censure motion criticised me for disagreeing with Jeremy Corbyn.
<seg id="7">	On the importance of a responsible economic policy, on national security, on Europe, ironically similar issues on which Jeremy disagreed with previous leaders.
<seg id="8">	The notice for the Nottingham East Labour meeting on Friday stated that "we want the meetings to be inclusive and productive."
<seg id="9">	For most of my eight years as the local Labour MP, the Friday night GC meetings have been exactly that.
<seg id="10">	Sadly today, it is not the tone of many meetings and the promise of "kinder, gentler" politics has long been forgotten if, indeed, it ever began.
<seg id="11">	It has become increasingly apparent that differing views are not tolerated in the Labour party and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to the party leadership.
<seg id="12">	This started shortly after Jeremy became leader, as colleagues with whom I had previously thought I shared a similar political outlook began expecting me to do a U-turn and take positions I would never have otherwise agreed with - whether on national security or the EU single market.
<seg id="13">	Whenever I speak publicly - and it doesn't really matter what I say - there follows a tirade of abuse on social media calling for deselection, denouncing the politics of the centre, telling me I should not be in the Labour party.
<seg id="14">	And that is not just my experience.
<seg id="15">	Indeed, I know I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues as the comments directed at me tend to be political.
<seg id="16">	I am in awe of the professionalism and determination of those colleagues who face a torrent of sexist or racist abuse every day but never shy away.
<seg id="17">	One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how levels of abuse have become normalised.
<seg id="18">	Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour party should foster a culture of tolerance.
<seg id="19">	The reality is Labour is no longer that broad church and with every "no-confidence" motion or change of selection rules it becomes narrower.
<seg id="20">	I have had lots of advice over the past two years urging me to keep my head down, not to be so vocal and then I would "be all right."
<seg id="21">	But that is not what I came into politics to do.
<seg id="22">	Ever since I joined Labour 32 years ago as a school pupil, provoked by the Thatcher government's neglect that had left my comprehensive school classroom literally falling down, I've sought to champion better public services for those who need them most - whether as a local councillor or government minister.
<seg id="23">	I have never hidden my politics, including at the last election.
<seg id="24">	No one in Nottingham East could have been in any way confused about my policy positions and areas of disagreement with the current leadership.
<seg id="25">	To those who promoted the motion on Friday, all I would say is that when the country is ploughing towards a Brexit that will hurt households, businesses and our public services, I do not understand the desire to waste time and energy on my loyalty to the Labour party leader.
<seg id="26">	But really the one message I have is not to Nottingham Momentum, it is to my constituents, whether Labour members or not: I am proud to serve you and I promise that no amount of deselection threats or political expediency will deter me from acting in what I believe are the best interests of you all.

<seg id="2">	KHLOE Kardashian's cheating ex Tristan Thompson has left ANOTHER desperate comment on her Instagram page following rumours that he wants her back.
<seg id="3">	The 35-year-old star dumped the NBA player for good earlier this year after he was accused of cheating on her with family friend Jordyn Woods - having previously cheated when she was nine months pregnant with their daughter, True.
<seg id="4">	Tristan was spotted leaving another gushing compliment on Khloe's Instagram page
<seg id="5">	However, 28-year-old Tristan is refusing to give up without a fight - leaving a cringeworthy compliment on his ex's latest selfie.
<seg id="6">	In the blurred snap, Khloe is stood in front of the rising sun, with the mum-of-one captioning the pic: "May you have the courage to explore every dream you dream."
<seg id="7">	Publicly commenting, Tristan wrote: "The sun is shining bright on a beautiful [diamond emoji]."
<seg id="8">	Fans were outraged by the remark, with one replying: "Yeah, a diamond that you DROPPED."
<seg id="9">	Tristan cheated on Khloe when she was nine months pregnant
<seg id="10">	Another advised: "Just get off Instagram."
<seg id="11">	A third wrote: "Don't be deceived!"
<seg id="12">	It comes just days after Tristan wrote: "Perfection" alongside the heart eye emojis underneath one of the reality stars other photos as a model for Guess Jeans.
<seg id="13">	Earlier this month, The Sun revealed that Tristan bought Khloe a £400,000 Porsche in a bid to win her back - on the advice of Drake.
<seg id="14">	He was then accused of cheating again earlier this year - with Kardashian family friend Jordyn Woods
<seg id="15">	He settled on the grovelling gift, thought to be a 911, after being urged to pull a "power move" by his rapper pal.
<seg id="16">	As a result, pals said Tristan even won an invite from Khloe to a Taco Tuesday dinner at her mansion - bringing him one step closer to a reunion with the reality star and their 17-month-old True.
<seg id="17">	A source said: "Tristan is good pals with Drake and has been using him as a sounding board as he plots his return to the Kardashian fold.
<seg id="18">	Khloe was left heartbroken by Tristan's infidelity
<seg id="19">	"Drake told him to pull out all the stops if he wanted to win Khloe back.
<seg id="20">	"An invite to a casual dinner might not sound like a reasonable trade off for a sleek supercar.
<seg id="21">	"But after what Tristan did, he can't expect the model to roll out the red carpet for him."
<seg id="22">	The pair are mum and dad to 17-month-old True
<seg id="23">	Khloe Kardashian breaks down in tears and screams at cheating boyfriend Tristan Thompson in new Keeping Up With The Kardashians series 16 trailer
<seg id="24">	The Sun revealed last month that Tristan planned to invite Khloe on a romantic trip to Greece after vowing: "I will get my family back."
<seg id="25">	Khloe has been left heartbroken by Tristan's repeated cheating throughout their romance, but still invited him to their daughter True's first birthday party earlier this year.
<seg id="26">	However, the star's family reality show Keeping Up With The Kardashians later showed that the event ended with Khloe in tears as she struggled to come to terms with his infidelity.

<seg id="2">	Warriors hope fans’ return to Chase Center gives team juice
<seg id="3">	Steph Curry says he’s ‘sick of looking at the blue tarp’, excited to see Warriors fans again at Chase Center
<seg id="4">	It’s Friday, April 23 — 409 days since the Warriors last played in front of their home crowd and the day fans will be welcomed back to Chase Center for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic.
<seg id="5">	“We got fans coming to Chase Center,” guard Kent Bazemore said Wednesday after Golden State’s loss in Washington.
<seg id="6">	“I cannot wait!
<seg id="7">	Bring it!
<seg id="8">	Let’s go!”
<seg id="9">	When the Warriors face the Denver Nuggets Friday night, it will be the first of nine games in which Chase Center will accommodate roughly 6,000 fans that have been either vaccinated or tested negative for COVID-19.
<seg id="10">	Though Warriors players and coaches have occasionally played in front of fans on the road this season, this opportunity to play to a home crowd has the team buzzing as they make their final playoff push.
<seg id="11">	“We’ve got a lot to look forward to,” head coach Steve Kerr said Wednesday, before returning to the Bay Area from a five-game trip.
<seg id="12">	“We have fans coming into our building for the first time in a couple of nights and that’s going to give us a lot of energy.
<seg id="13">	A lot of juice!”
<seg id="14">	The Warriors are 17-10 in home games this season despite fans not being in attendance.
<seg id="15">	To create any semblance of a tone, the organization at the beginning of the season lowered its championship banners to display behind one of the baskets.
<seg id="16">	Various advertisements have been strategically placed for the television cameras, and a video board of fans mimicked the concept used in last season’s Orlando bubble.
<seg id="17">	Other than a sparse crowd of select friends and family, Chase Center’s bowl has been covered by a blue tarp with a Warriors logo.
<seg id="18">	“We are going to enjoy the atmosphere,” guard Stephen Curry said.
<seg id="19">	“I think I’ve talked about it before, it’s definitely noticeable if you have even just a thousand fans in the seats.
<seg id="20">	It makes a huge difference in the atmosphere and whatnot.
<seg id="21">	“We’ve had a whole season now where we haven’t had any fans, so you’re kind of sick of looking at the blue tarp and want to see some bodies in there.”
<seg id="22">	The last time Chase Center hosted fans was on March 10, 2020, a Warriors 131-107 loss to the Los Angeles Clippers.
<seg id="23">	A night later, the NBA season was postponed when Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for the virus.
<seg id="24">	In its second season since its grand opening, Chase Center hasn’t been the home of much celebration.
<seg id="25">	Curry suffered a broken left hand in just the second home game of the regular season last year and Golden State stumbled to a 15-50 record before not being invited to the bubble.
<seg id="26">	Now the Warriors (29-30) are on the cusp of their first playoff berth since 2019.
<seg id="27">	With 13 games remaining — including a six-game homestand to conclude the regular season — each one matters when it comes to playoff seeding.
<seg id="28">	“Fans bring an extra set of passion and emotion to the game,” guard Kelly Oubre Jr. said.
<seg id="29">	“So I’m super excited to get back out there and perform in front of them, also hear their chants, their cheers.
<seg id="30">	It’s going to be super exciting.”

<doc	https://www.zdnet.com/article/arm-processors-everything-you-need-to-know-now/ 2021>
<seg id="1">	Arm processors: Everything you need to know now
<seg id="2">	The ninth generation of the Arm processor architecture, its engineers say, could sustain distributed computing for the rest of this decade.
<seg id="3">	Could the rise of Arm signal the end of central processing units as we know them?
<seg id="4">	The most important thing you need to understand about the role Arm processor architecture plays in any computing or communications market -- smartphones, personal computers, servers, or otherwise -- is this: Arm Holdings, Ltd., which is based in Cambridge, UK, designs the components of processors for others to build.
<seg id="5">	Arm owns these designs, along with the architecture of their instruction sets, such as 64-bit ARM64.
<seg id="6">	Its business model is to license the intellectual property (IP) for these components and the instruction set to other companies, enabling them to build systems around them that incorporate their own designs as well as Arm's.
<seg id="7">	For its customers who build systems around these chips, Arm has done the hard part for them.
<seg id="8">	How does Arm, a chip company, conduct business without making chips?
<seg id="9">	Arm Holdings, Ltd. does not manufacture its own chips.
<seg id="10">	It has no fabrication facilities of its own.
<seg id="11">	Instead, it licenses these rights to other companies, which Arm Holdings calls "partners."
<seg id="12">	They utilize Arm's architectural model as a kind of template, building systems that use Arm cores as their central processors.
<seg id="13">	These Arm partners are given the opportunity to design, and possibly manufacture, their systems around these processors, or else outsource their production to others, but in any event sell implementations of these designs in commercial markets.
<seg id="14">	Many Samsung and Apple smartphones and tablets, and essentially all devices produced by Qualcomm, utilize some Arm intellectual property.
<seg id="15">	A new wave of servers produced with Arm-based systems-on-a-chip (SoC) has already made headway in competing against x86, especially with low-power or special-use models.
<seg id="16">	Each device incorporating an Arm processor tends to be its own, unique system, like the multi-part Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 mobile processor depicted above.
<seg id="17">	WHY X86 IS SOLD AND ARM IS LICENSED
<seg id="18">	The maker of an Intel- or AMD-based x86 computer does not design nor does it own any portion of the intellectual property for the CPU.
<seg id="19">	It also cannot reproduce x86 IP for its own purposes.
<seg id="20">	Intel Inside is a seal certifying a license for the device manufacturer to build a machine around Intel's processor.
<seg id="21">	An Arm-based device may be designed to incorporate the processor, perhaps even making adaptations to its architecture and functionality.
<seg id="22">	Since Arm has no interest in marketing itself to end users, you don't typically hear much about "Arm Inside."
<seg id="23">	Equally important, however, is the fact that an Arm chip is not necessarily a central processor.
<seg id="24">	Depending on the design of its system, it can be the heart of a device controller, a microcontroller (MCU), or some other subordinate component in a system.
<seg id="25">	WHAT'S THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ARM AND APPLE?
<seg id="26">	Apple Silicon is the phrase Apple presently uses to describe its own processor production, beginning in June 2020 with Apple's announcement of the replacement of its x86 Mac processor line.
<seg id="27">	In its place, in Mac laptop units that are reportedly already shipping, will be a new system-on-a-chip called A12Z, code-named "Bionic," produced by Apple using 64-bit component designs licensed to it by Arm Holdings, Ltd.
<seg id="28">	In this case, Arm isn't the designer, but the producer of the instruction set around which Apple makes its original design.
<seg id="29">	In December 2020, Apple chose Taiwan-based TSMC as the fabricator for its A12Z.
<seg id="30">	For MacOS 11 to continue to run software compiled for Intel processors, under an Arm SoC, the new system will run a kind of "just-in-time" instruction translator called Rosetta 2.
<seg id="31">	Rather than run an old MacOS image in a virtual machine, the new OS will run a live x86 machine code translator that re-fashions x86 code into what Apple now calls Universal 2 binary code -- an intermediate-level code that can still be made to run on older Intel-based Macs -- in real-time.
<seg id="32">	That code will run in what sources outside of Apple call an "emulator," but which isn't really an emulator in that it doesn't simulate the execution of code in an actual, physical machine (there is no "Universal 2" chip).
<seg id="33">	The first results of independent performance benchmarks comparing an iPad Pro using the A12Z chip planned for the first Arm-based Macs, against Microsoft Surface models, looked promising.
<seg id="34">	Geekbench results as of the time of this writing gave the Bionic-powered tablet a multi-core processing score of 4669 (higher is better), versus 2966 for the Pentium-powered Surface Pro X, and 3033 for the Core i5-powered Surface Pro 6.
<seg id="35">	Apple's newly claimed ability to produce its own SoC for Mac, just as it does for iPhone and iPad, could save the company over time as much as 60 percent on production costs, according to its own estimates.
<seg id="36">	Of course, Apple is typically tight-lipped as to how it arrives at that estimate, and how long such savings will take to be realized.
<seg id="37">	The relationship between Apple and Arm Holdings dates back to 1990, when Apple Computer UK became a founding co-stakeholder in Arm Holdings, Ltd.
<seg id="38">	The other co-partners at that time were the Arm concept's originator, Acorn Computers Ltd. (more about Acorn later) and custom semiconductor maker VLSI Technology (named for the common semiconductor manufacturing process called "very large-scale integration").
<seg id="39">	Today, Arm Holdings is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SoftBank, which announced its intent to purchase the licensor in July 2016.
<seg id="40">	At the time, the acquisition deal was the largest for a Europe-based technology firm.

<seg id="28">	And the second I looked in that baby's eyes, I knew in that exact moment that if we were ever under attack, I would use my wife as a human shield to protect that baby.
<seg id="29">	Different Daughters
<seg id="30">	“What’s crazy is my 2-year-old wakes up at night,” Lively said on Live With Kelly and Ryan in 2016.
<seg id="31">	“She’s the baby, basically.

<seg id="35">	Planning ahead!
<seg id="36">	“Ryan had a nice, normal upbringing, and we want our kids to have the same normal life that we had,” the two-time mom told Marie Claire in 2016.

<seg id="48">	“I would rather drink a piping hot bowl of liquid rabies than get on a plane with my two children,” Reynolds admitted on Good Morning America in 2017.
<seg id="49">	“At 2 years old they just have to rip all their clothes off and introduce themselves to everyone on the plane, it’s just like, ‘Please can we land in a farmer’s field?’”
<seg id="50">	Namesake
<seg id="51">	In 2018, the actor explained why he named one of his daughters James, after his father.
<seg id="52">	“It felt right,” he told Marie Claire.
<seg id="53">	“At the end of the day, it’s easier to focus on the good stuff than the bad.
<seg id="54">	My father died soon after my daughter was born, but he got to see her, which makes me happy.”
<seg id="55">	Helicopter Dad
<seg id="56">	“When they decide to go away to college, I’m going to be that guy, ‘That’s so funny, I’m going to NYU, too!’” Reynolds told Extra in 2019.
<seg id="57">	“I’m going to be so needy.
<seg id="58">	I love being around them — it’s the best thing in the world.”
<seg id="59">	Big Fans
<seg id="60">	“My daughter James is losing her mind over it,” Reynolds said of his Pokemon: Detective Pikachu movie in a May 2019 Good Morning America appearance.
<seg id="61">	“She’s never been interested in a movie I’ve done ever.
<seg id="62">	I’m curious how [my daughter Inez] is going to react to it.”
<seg id="63">	The actor added: "They do know Deadpool.
<seg id="64">	They sometimes say it, and it's sort of embarrassing.
<seg id="65">	I'll be in a grocery store and they'll be like, 'My daddy's Deadpool.'

<seg id="70">	I understand how overwhelming it is to be a new parent,” Lively said of her Amazon baby registry in October 2019. 
<seg id="71">	"What they don’t tell you is it never gets less overwhelming, but with each kid, I do learn more."
<seg id="72">	High Hopes
<seg id="73">	“I love B.C.,” Reynolds tweeted in October 2019 following the birth of his and Lively’s third child.
<seg id="74">	“I want my daughters to experience the same natural playground I grew up in.”
<seg id="75">	Following His Footsteps
<seg id="76">	Although James loves "singing songs, doing plays at home [and performing in movies]," Reynolds is warning her against child acting, he revealed during a December 2019 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.
<seg id="77">	Showbiz is not good for kids, the 6 Underground star explained.
<seg id="78">	I feel like we should know this by now, right?
<seg id="79">	But parents everywhere are like, ‘Yeah, let's just put them in a movie, unsupervised.'
<seg id="80">	Groupie
<seg id="81">	“She’s obsessed.
<seg id="82">	Jimmy Fallon is Shawn Mendes to my daughter, like, legitimately," the Canadian star added.

<seg id="84">	Happy at Home
<seg id="85">	“They are doing great,” Reynolds told Extra in December 2019 when asked about his wife and their third child.
<seg id="86">	No Name
<seg id="87">	The Golden Globe nominee went on to joke that he and Lively have not chosen a moniker for their third child to give her something to push against in life."
<seg id="88">	Reynolds teased, "All of the letters in her name are silent."
<seg id="89">	Dad Guilt
<seg id="90">	Leaving the house is getting harder and harder,” Reynolds admitted during a December 2019 Today show appearance.
<seg id="91">	“It gets a lot harder when they ask, ‘Where are you going?
<seg id="92">	When are you coming home?
<seg id="93">	Why are you leaving me?’”
<seg id="94">	Looking Back
<seg id="95">	“Dear abs, I miss you,” the actress captioned a throwback Instagram Story photo in January 2020, three months after giving birth to her third daughter.
<seg id="96">	Cute Chaos
<seg id="97">	It's like going from two to 3,000," Lively said on Good Morning America in January 2020 of raising three kids.
<seg id="98">	I mean, we have so many children.
<seg id="99">	It's pretty crazy.
<seg id="100">	It's a lot.
<seg id="101">	Tough Time
<seg id="102">	Our oldest is loving on [our newborn] and is very maternal, and our middle daughter just keeps away from her, Lively revealed during a January 2020 appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.
<seg id="103">	I said to her, ‘You’re going to teach her everything she knows.
<seg id="104">	You get to teach her about cities and the sky and flowers and Santa Claus.
<seg id="105">	Anything you want.’
<seg id="106">	And she goes, ‘Oh, I didn’t love you, but now I do.'
<seg id="107">	Fan Girl
<seg id="108">	The actress went on to say, "We’ve got to stay away from you, Jimmy.
<seg id="109">	[James] is so intimidated by you.

<seg id="111">	Jimmy Fallon, can’t speak.

<seg id="116">	“3 Kids = Me. So. Sleepy.”
<seg id="117">	Tons of Teasing
<seg id="118">	After I gave birth, he was like, 'Oh, my gosh, if I lost you and I went to the park with our three kids, think of the ladies I can pick up,'
<seg id="119">	Lively said of her husband during a January 2020 Live With Kelly and Ryan appearance.
<seg id="120">	Mom Goals
<seg id="123">	That same month, she told E! News, "The only reason I have kids is so I can eat Rice Krispies Treats for every meal of the day and be really proud of it."
<seg id="121">	Fit Mamma
<seg id="122">	Lively revealed in January 2020 that while filming The Rhythm Section in Europe, she balanced her girls and workouts by combining the two.
<seg id="124">	I woke up at 5 a.m., but mostly because I was doing momma duty with my girls, she told Vanity Fair in a video interview breaking down a day in her life on set.
<seg id="125">	I would actually wake up and work out with my girls.
<seg id="126">	So I would sort of use them as weights.
<seg id="127">	Instead of wearing a weight vest, I got to wear my children.
<seg id="128">	Picky Parent
<seg id="129">	“I guess I really have to really, really, really, really love it because I’m just obsessed with my kids,” Lively told E! News in February 2020 of choosing film projects.
<seg id="130">	“It’s gotta really be worth it to take me away.”
<seg id="131">	Quarantine Cuties
<seg id="132">	We're doing a lot of home-schooling,” Reynolds said of social distancing with his kids during an April 2020 virtual appearance on A Late Show With Stephen Colbert at Home.
<seg id="133">	“We're lucky enough to have a little, tiny garden, so we're learning a little bit about gardening.
<seg id="134">	We’re trying to make this an educational experience, but I’m mostly drinking.”
<seg id="135">	The actor went on to joke that he wouldn't hesitate" to eat his three daughters.
<seg id="136">	Proud Papa
<seg id="137">	“With three kids in the house, I need [my Aviation Gin] more than ever,” Reynolds joked in a June 2020 ad about how “proud” he is of his alcohol brand.
<seg id="138">	Another One
<seg id="139">	When Lively joked that she "got ... pregnant" from watching one of Reynolds' Instagram videos in July 2020, he replied, "@blakelively I will be out of the office starting July 22nd throughout the middle or forever and ever.
<seg id="140">	If you need immediate assistance during my absence, please contact someone.

<seg id="142">	Otherwise I will respond to your message as soon as possible upon my unlikely return.
<seg id="143">	Thank you.”
<seg id="144">	Next Generation
<seg id="145">	“We’ve been teaching our children differently than the way our parents taught us,” the actress wrote in a May Instagram slideshow.
<seg id="146">	“We want to educate ourselves about other people’s experiences and talk to our kids about everything, all of it.
<seg id="147">	Especially our own complicity.
<seg id="148">	We’re committed to raising our kids so they never grow up feeding this insane pattern and they’ll do their best to never inflict pain on another being consciously or unconsciously."
<seg id="149">	Custom Coverings
<seg id="150">	We won’t embarrass them at all in middle school, Lively captioned an August 2020 Instagram Story photo of herself and Reynolds rocking homemade face masks designed by their daughters.
<seg id="151">	Life Lessons
<seg id="152">	Lively opened up about wanting to “teach and grow” her children while celebrating Indigenous People’s Day in October 2020.
<seg id="153">	It’s never too late to learn ourselves,” the actress captioned her Instagram Story.
<seg id="154">	Darling Daughters
<seg id="155">	Reynolds told Access in November 2020 that he loves being “a girl dad,” gushing, “I have three daughters, which I never in a million years would imagine.
<seg id="156">	I come from all boys.
<seg id="157">	I have three older brothers.
<seg id="158">	So for me, to have three daughters has been such a ride and I love every second of it.”
<seg id="159">	Staying Socially Distant

<seg id="163">	“My hat’s off to so many others doing the same.”
<seg id="164">	Body Positive
<seg id="165">	Lively wrote via Instagram in January 2021 that she felt “silly” for being “insecure” about not fitting into sample sizes after giving birth to baby No. 3.

<seg id="172">	I have three daughters, so Blake and myself and the kids will sit down and watch the game for about four, four and a half seconds, before it's switched over to Paw Patrol,” Reynolds joked during a February 2021 Good Morning America appearance.
<seg id="173">	And then I'll be watching the game from my phone.
<seg id="174">	Or, I may just wander outside and stare at the sun directly.
<seg id="175">	I don't know.

<seg id="1">	Giant fans of wind energy
<seg id="2">	Windmills aren't what they used to be but then neither is the search for renewable energy sources.
<seg id="3">	Patricia Mahoney
<seg id="4">	Associate Editor
<seg id="5">	In an effort to develop renewable energy sources, engineers are looking for ways to build a better mousetrap.
<seg id="6">	Or, in this case, windmill.
<seg id="7">	As manufacturers continue to lower the cost of wind turbines and components, wind energy may soon compete cost-wise with conventional energy sources.
<seg id="8">	Thanks largely to virtual prototyping and physical prototype testing, engineers are moving closer to that goal.
<seg id="9">	But there's a problem when it comes to simulating wind turbines.
<seg id="10">	Complex aerodynamic effects and large deflections are at work.
<seg id="11">	And the electrical systems are sophisticated and difficult to model.
<seg id="12">	Physical prototype testing is no walk in the park either.
<seg id="13">	The source of the power for field tests is, of course, the wind, which can't be controlled.
<seg id="14">	Also, modern wind turbines are huge, which means facilities for full-scale testing must be supersized, too.
<seg id="15">	To overcome these obstacles, other countries have developed strategies that could serve as blueprints to help the U.S.
<seg id="16">	Spain, for example, is a global leader in installed capacity and wind-turbine manufacturing.
<seg id="17">	The Spanish Centre for Renewable Energy (Cener) is currently building an innovative test center dedicated to developing wind energy.
<seg id="18">	The publicly funded facility will have testing laboratories and an experimental wind farm.
<seg id="19">	A blade-testing facility will house two rigs to conduct extreme and fatigue-load tests as well as physical-properties testing.
<seg id="20">	It will handle turbine blades up to 75-m long.
<seg id="21">	One rig, able to withstand bending moments up to 100.000 kNm, could test blades as long as 90 m, after a portion of the blade is removed.
<seg id="22">	The Spanish lab will develop processes and materials to reduce costs or improve performance, mainly in the area of composites.
<seg id="23">	An experimental manufacturing workshop will test new processes, and a materialcharacterization laboratory will study physical, chemical, and mechanical properties.
<seg id="24">	The center will also conduct testing (power curve, mechanical loads, noise, and power quality) at its own experimental wind farm.
<seg id="25">	A wind tunnel, with a test section of 1.5x3 m, can reach Reynold numbers of 9x106 for aerodynamic and aeroacoustic airfoil tests.
<seg id="26">	Specially designed dynos will simulate real-life wind-turbine loads.
<seg id="27">	Most dynos are good at applying torque, but little else.
<seg id="28">	The drivetrains in wind turbines, however, see a variety of asymmetrical loading scenarios as winds gain force, die down, and change direction.
<seg id="29">	These dynos will handle turbines up to 5 MW.
<seg id="30">	The drivetrain test rig will perform functional and mechanical (fatigue and extreme load) tests.
<seg id="31">	An 8-MW electrical motor, gearbox, and hydraulic actuators will introduce forces and moments on the shaft in three directions.
<seg id="32">	An electrical-system test rig will produce voltage dips and other electrical faults.
<seg id="33">	Another test rig will perform functional tests on all of the elements in the nacelle.
<seg id="34">	With all this technology, the Spanish wind-turbine laboratory will be one of the largest exclusively dedicated facilities anywhere.
<seg id="35">	EVOLUTION OF THE TURBINE
<seg id="36">	For two decades, turbine manufacturers have examined various ways of turning wind energy into power.
<seg id="37">	The design that has proved most efficient and reliable is the three-bladed model.
<seg id="38">	Recent models generate several megawatts versus a few hundred kilowatts for early versions.
<seg id="39">	And wind turbines are taller, to access stronger, more stable winds.
<seg id="40">	The standardized shape of wind turbines is evidence of the industry's relative maturity.
<seg id="41">	Now, manufacturers set themselves apart by incremental developments such as reducing weight and boosting efficiency.
<seg id="42">	For example, Gamesa Eolica, a Spanish turbine builder, focuses on pitch technology.
<seg id="43">	Gigantic wind turbines are becoming an increasingly common sight around the globe.
<seg id="44">	Men working on a nacelle and rotor give an indication of the machine's size.
<seg id="45">	How high is too high?
<seg id="46">	Wind turbines are reaching ever higher.
<seg id="47">	Wind quality improves with height, especially inland where obstacles on the ground produce turbulence.
<seg id="48">	But it costs more to put up taller towers, and hub height is limited by law.
<seg id="49">	Typical height limits are between 80 and 100 m in the U.S., but some German installations are reaching hub heights of more than 100 m.
<seg id="50">	Towers of 80 m have a rotor sweep of 35 to 125 m; 100-m towers have a rotor sweep of 55 to 145 m.
<seg id="51">	Experts say 100-m towers are better for inland locations while 80-m towers work better on the coast.
<seg id="52">	According to the Global Wind Energy Council, global windpower capacity has been rising by at least 20% annually since 2000.
<seg id="53">	Modern wind turbines produce 200x more power than equivalent turbines of two decades ago.
<seg id="54">	Today, there are more than 50,000 MW of installed wind-power capacity around the world, up from only 17,000 MW a decade ago.
<seg id="55">	The world, you might say, is becoming a big fan of wind energy.

<seg id="1">	Wide-Angle Oddity: Giant Bidens Meet Tiny Carters
<seg id="2">	A picture of two presidents and first ladies led to many Hobbit jokes online.
<seg id="3">	We explain what happened.
<seg id="4">	Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, received a visit from President Biden and Jill Biden at their home in Plains, Ga., last month.
<seg id="5">	The photo caused a stir.
<seg id="6">	By Heather Murphy
<seg id="7">	It was a pleasant 86 or so degrees in Plains, Ga., when President Biden and Jill Biden visited former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, at their home on April 29.
<seg id="8">	Dr. Biden wore a dress covered in lemons and two delicate silver bracelets.
<seg id="9">	Ms. Carter was dressed more casually in a white long-sleeved T-shirt, sneakers and a smart watch.
<seg id="10">	Mr. Biden wore a royal-blue suit, and Mr. Carter a sport coat over a T-shirt.
<seg id="11">	“We just had a nice time,” Mr. Biden said later.
<seg id="12">	Reporters were not permitted inside, but a photo of the two couples that the Carter Center posted Monday on Twitter — with its toothy grins and teacups — seemed to back this up.
<seg id="13">	Except one thing was off: At some point during the visit, the Bidens appeared to have turned into giants.
<seg id="14">	Dr. Biden is 5-foot-6.
<seg id="15">	So far as the world knows.
<seg id="16">	Mr. Carter, 96, stood around 5-foot-10 at his tallest.
<seg id="17">	But even kneeling, she appeared to dwarf him.
<seg id="18">	And Mr. Biden, who is six feet tall, seemed to hover above the man he had come to pay his respects to.
<seg id="19">	It was if the hosts had been turned into Hobbits.
<seg id="20">	“Did they pull some Gandalf/Hobbit perspective trickery or are the Biden’s actually this gigantic?” one man asked on Twitter.
<seg id="21">	Another user asked if she was “the only one who thinks this looks like a tiny doll museum, and Joe and Jill are giants?”
<seg id="22">	In a thread on Reddit that was full of Hobbit jokes, others countered that perhaps age had shrunk the former president to three feet.
<seg id="23">	Or maybe, some wondered, there was something going on with the lens.
<seg id="24">	So which is it?
<seg id="25">	Reached by phone Adam Schultz, the chief official White House photographer, confirmed that he took the photo but declined to explain.
<seg id="26">	“It’s for people to figure out and think about,” he said.
<seg id="27">	The answer can be found in Mr. Carter’s gigantic shoes, said Pete Souza, a former chief official White House photographer for President Barack Obama.
<seg id="28">	Compared to the rest of him they look huge.
<seg id="29">	“That to me is an indication that the foreground was distorted by a super-wide-angle lens,” he said.
<seg id="30">	Such lenses can be helpful when a photographer is trying to shoot several people in a small room and cannot get far back enough to get everyone in the same frame with another lens.
<seg id="31">	But they are notorious for distorting proportions, Mr. Souza said.
<seg id="32">	Sharon Schneider, the editor in chief of PetaPixel, a photography and camera news website, had a similar theory.
<seg id="33">	“It’s called perspective distortion,” said the editor-chief.
<seg id="34">	Wide-angle lenses make objects closer to the camera appear to be much larger than objects that are even just a tiny bit farther away.
<seg id="35">	Because the Carters are leaning back, the wide-angle lens exaggerates the few inches between them and the Bidens, Mrs. Schneider said.
<seg id="36">	Had the Bidens and Carters been seated on exactly the same plane, this effect would not have been so striking.
<seg id="37">	This is why the two men’s shoes seem to be on a similar scale.
<seg id="38">	The placement of the chairs also exacerbates the distortion, she said.
<seg id="39">	The center of a wide-angle photo tends to look natural.
<seg id="40">	But once you start moving toward the edge of the photo, the proportions get increasingly distorted.
<seg id="41">	Had everyone been huddled around the lamp, the effect would not have been so noticeable.
<seg id="42">	“Wide-angle lenses have this angle no matter how optically correct they are,” Mrs. Schneider said, adding that these sorts of optical distortions can be fixed in post production.
<seg id="43">	But while editing the photo may have made it look more realistic, that would be frowned upon, said Doug Mills, a photographer assigned to the Washington bureau of The New York Times.
<seg id="44">	Mr. Mills was outside the Carters’ home during the photo session and saw the flash go off inside.
<seg id="45">	He agreed that it seemed likely that a wide-angle lens was used to solve the problem of capturing all four subjects in a small space.
<seg id="46">	Some asked why the Carter Center would release a distorted photo, or why it was not edited to remove the distortion.
<seg id="47">	“That would be completely forbidden,” Mr. Mills said.
<seg id="48">	Official White House photographers are supposed to abide by ethical rules similar to those followed by photojournalists, he said.
<seg id="49">	The picture, for all its amusing flaws, is history.

<seg id="1">	"I felt alone as a woman": von der Leyen says Turkey chair controversy wouldn't have happened to a man
<seg id="2">	The commission president was denied a chair at top-level talks in Ankara this month.
<seg id="3">	Ursula von der Leyen speaks during a debate in the European Parliament yesterday
<seg id="4">	URSULA VON DER Leyen has said that a recent controversy in Turkey where she was denied a chair at top-level talks emphasises the EU’s need to tackle sexism.
<seg id="5">	In comments to MEPs about the incident, which has been dubbed “sofagate”, the European Commission president also took apparent aim at European Council chief Charles Michel.
<seg id="6">	Much of the commentary on the affair has focused on Turkish President Recep Tayyip’s Erdogan’s diplomatic faux pas in failing to provide a chair for von der Leyen.
<seg id="7">	But von der Leyen told the European Parliament that she could see no reason in the EU’s own rules why she should have been treated differently to Michel.
<seg id="8">	Michel was quick to take the single chair set out next to Erdogan and the EU and Turkish flags, relegating a visibly annoyed von der Leyen to a sofa further away.
<seg id="9">	“I am the first woman to be President of the European Commission.
<seg id="10">	I am the President of the European Commission,” von der Leyen said, ahead of a parliamentary debate on EU-Turkey ties.
<seg id="11">	“And this is how I expected to be treated when visiting Turkey two weeks ago, like a commission president, but I was not.
<seg id="12">	I cannot find any justification for what I was treated in the European treaties.
<seg id="13">	“So I have to conclude that had happened because I am a woman.”
<seg id="14">	She added: “I felt hurt and I felt alone as a woman.
<seg id="15">	I felt alone as a European.”
<seg id="16">	Immediately after the meeting in Ankara earlier this month, when footage emerged of von der Leyen’s embarrassment, some European officials stressed that Michel is technically her senior in the diplomatic hierarchy.
<seg id="17">	But von der Leyen has made it clear that she expects to be treated as an equal with her fellow EU leader.
<seg id="18">	And she said that not only must a respect for women’s rights be “a prerequisite for a resumption of dialogue with Turkey”, but that Europe itself must do better on this front.
<seg id="19">	Turkey has been criticised for withdrawing from the Istanbul Convention on halting violence against women but, as von der Leyen recalled, several EU members have still not ratified the treaty at all.
<seg id="20">	“And others are thinking about quitting.
<seg id="21">	This is not acceptable,” she said, warning that she would try to find a way for the EU itself to join the convention despite resistance from some capitals.

<seg id="15">	The factors are: the weather, debt level (specifically, the difference between debt and our ability to pay), the amount of time since Christmas, time since failing our New Year's resolutions, low motivational levels and the feeling of a need to take charge of the situation.
<seg id="16">	Is it the same as Seasonal Affective Disorder?
<seg id="17">	No.
<seg id="18">	January blues is a situational depression and is associated with how we think and feel.
<seg id="19">	Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD) can affect people for a month at a time and doctors believe it is related to how the body responds to sunlight.
<seg id="20">	Alison Kerry, from the mental health charity Mind, says: "With SAD, one theory is that light entering the eye causes changes in hormone levels in the body.
<seg id="21">	In our bodies, light functions to stop the production of the sleep hormone melatonin, making us wake up.
<seg id="22">	It's thought that SAD sufferers are affected by shorter daylight hours in the winter.
<seg id="23">	They produce higher melatonin, causing lethargy and symptoms of depression."
<seg id="24">	The January blues can start after the Christmas period
<seg id="25">	How do you know you are suffering from the January blues?
<seg id="26">	People start to suffer from the January blues right after the holidays when all the festive decorations are gone and things are back to normal.
<seg id="27">	You can start to feel lonely after friends and family you saw over the holidays have left.
<seg id="28">	Sluggish from the excess food and drinking, and let down if your New Year hasn’t gotten off the start you had hopes for.
<seg id="29">	Mental health charity Mind is derisive of the notion of Blue Monday, claiming the concept has no foundation in scientific research.
<seg id="30">	A statement on their websites says: "Here at Mind, we think it’s dangerously misleading.
<seg id="31">	Those of us who live with depression know that those feelings aren’t dictated by the date.
<seg id="32">	Implying that they are perpetuates the myth that depression is just 'feeling a bit down', something that doesn’t need to be taken seriously."
<seg id="33">	Mind’s Head of Information Stephen Buckley said: “Blue Monday contributes to damaging misconceptions about depression and trivialises an illness that can be life threatening."
<seg id="34">	Multiple branches of the Samaritans charity across the UK are aiming to turn Blue Monday into Brew Monday and will be offering a brew and a chat at events across the country, the Samaritans helpline is free to call every day of the year.
<seg id="35">	How do you deal with January blues?
<seg id="36">	Sometimes going for a walk or finishing a project you started are ways to deal with the emotional lull.
<seg id="37">	Sword says: “Get out in nature, even if it's for a little while.
<seg id="38">	“Take a walk around the block and look for wildlife; enjoy a favorite meal with loved ones; call a friend or family member to check in; finish that project you started last summer, if you can.
<seg id="39">	“You are unique and valuable so enjoy your beautiful life."
<seg id="40">	Exercise, starting an activity you've wanted to do for ages and enjoying time with friends and family all help to banish the winter blues.
<seg id="41">	Personal trainer Andy Ward advises that exercise is a great tonic to feeling down, and it's best to avoid binge-eating and shunning your mates.
<seg id="42">	He said: "Squeeze in 30 minutes of exercise, it could be a fast walk, a light jog, a relaxing swim, or an intense HIIT class - just move for thirty minutes to feel the benefits.
<seg id="43">	“There are dozens of different fitness classes available.
<seg id="44">	January is a great time to take up new hobbies and meet new people.”

<seg id="1">	How costumes in period dramas shape our perception of royalty
<seg id="2">	Our version of the present-day royals is carefully constructed and curated.
<seg id="3">	Kept at bay behind a red velvet rope, we will never get a glimpse into the bedrooms and offices of regal power.
<seg id="4">	That is, other than in period dramas.
<seg id="5">	In film and TV dramatisations of familiar royal tales, the audience is presented with a romanticised and glamorised vision of royal history.
<seg id="6">	Sumptuous silks and gilded homes make up the lush material world on screen.
<seg id="7">	In reality, they are far removed from the bed bugs, tedious political documents and the stench of recently used chamber pots.
<seg id="8">	The visuals are so rich that audiences will often remember the wonderful costumes, forgetting the the bloody details of the Wars of the Roses or the shady political machinations of royal court.
<seg id="9">	From the high ruffs and jewelled headpieces of the Tudors to the ballgowns and tiaras of modern royals on screen, these costume provide a glossy veneer to people and history that is, at times, quite dark.
<seg id="10">	These individuals become characters in costumes.
<seg id="11">	They become nothing more than well dressed princes and princesses, kings and queens in stories that often overtake reality.
<seg id="12">	Royal stereotypes
<seg id="13">	Costuming choices can reinforce well-worn and familiar royal stereotypes.
<seg id="14">	If you imagine Queen Victoria in mourning, you might envision Judy Dench in black silk and a widow’s cap.
<seg id="15">	Thinking about Elizabeth I might make you picture a regal Helen Mirren in a ruff protruding from her neck.
<seg id="16">	And party-loving Charles II brings to mind the lustrous curly locks of Rufus Sewell in a long wig.
<seg id="17">	Costumes can also radically challenge and rewrite how we view past royals.
<seg id="18">	Portraits by Hans Holbein of Henry VIII in his later years and early screen depictions have are of a corpulent king and bejewelled monarch.
<seg id="19">	Joan Bergin’s costuming of Jonathan Rhys Meyers’s Henry VIII in The Tudors (2007-2010) instead included lots of leather, tight doublets, and open shirts.
<seg id="20">	Bergin’s costumes transformed the serial groom into a sexy sportsman, rescuing this younger incarnation of Henry VIII from historical oblivion.
<seg id="21">	Dressing up like Diana
<seg id="22">	The Crown is the latest screen delight to offer us a glimpse behind the royal curtain and fans can’t seem to get enough of Princess Diana, portrayed by Emma Corrin.
<seg id="23">	Unlike Henry VIII, Diana was in no need of an image update.
<seg id="24">	The princess was a fashion symbol in her lifetime, and The Crown’s season four costume designer, Amy Roberts, took the opportunity to recreate some of Diana’s genuine iconic outfits.
<seg id="25">	Roberts’ recreation of Diana’s early wardrobe was remarkably faithful, treading a fine line between historical fact and fantasy.
<seg id="26">	Such was the furore over the fashion that brands have seized upon the outfits, creating wearable versions for a new generation of Diana fans who are eager to emulate the late princess.
<seg id="27">	In October 2020, Corrin hit the cover of Vogue in a Diana-esque 1980s concoction and copies of Diana’s iconic sheep jumper can be purchased for an eye-watering £250.
<seg id="28">	While Diana’s 1980s chic (now considered period costume) has enjoyed a revival in mainstream fashion, it resonates with a desire to cosplay as a royal.
<seg id="29">	Costumed characters
<seg id="30">	Even in historical documentaries about the monarchs, which are framed as authentic and factual accounts of Britain’s royal past, historians like Lucy Worsley are renowned for using dressing up as a way to breathe life into long-dead monarchs.
<seg id="31">	While Worsley’s “dress-up box” version of history may not be for everyone, it plays into a desire to humanise historical characters.
<seg id="32">	Like the living history interpreters that (before COVID) inhabited the Historic Royal Palaces sites that Worsley oversees, donning a doublet and hose resuscitates royals who we can otherwise only view in oil paintings.
<seg id="33">	Costume may help us time travel, but by lacing up a corset, tying on a ruff, or even donning a Sloane ranger Barbour jacket, a modern-day human being cosplays as royal, rendering that person a caricature.
<seg id="34">	The costume creates a distance between the real person with all their problematic behaviour and turns them into beautifully dressed symbol of a bygone Britishness.
<seg id="35">	There is certainly magic in the costumes but that magic can obscure the darker parts of royal history, which should be remembered.

<seg id="1">	A Shrunken Head Used As A Prop In A 1970s Comedy Turned Out To Be The Real Head Of An Amazon Warrior
<seg id="2">	By Kaleena Fraga
<seg id="3">	Published May 19, 2021
<seg id="4">	The shrunken head was donated to a Georgia university after an Air Force officer brought it home from Ecuador in the 1940s.
<seg id="5">	Almost 100 years ago in the Ecuadorian Amazon, a warrior died at the hands of an enemy.
<seg id="6">	After being traded to an American, the shrunken head was brought to Mercer University in Macon, Georgia.
<seg id="7">	His head was cut off, boiled, and shrunk into a war trophy.
<seg id="8">	There, it was put on display, used as a film prop, and eventually locked into storage.
<seg id="9">	But after a careful authentication process, the shrunken head — called a tsantsa — was finally sent home in 2019.
<seg id="10">	An article published in May in Heritage Science has documented that process for the first time.
<seg id="11">	“This is not an oddity — this is somebody’s body, this is somebody’s culture, and it’s not ours,” said Mercer University chemist Mary Kiefer, one of the article’s co-authors.
<seg id="12">	“So from our perspective, repatriation was essential, and we were very lucky that our university supported this endeavor.”
<seg id="13">	After years in storage, the head was first rediscovered by Keifer’s co-author, a Mercer biologist named Joan Byron.
<seg id="14">	Byron, overseeing the transfer of various taxidermy specimens to a new science building, realized that the Ecuadorian shrunken head needed a second look.
<seg id="15">	Byron and her colleagues didn’t know much about the head, but started piecing its story together.
<seg id="16">	Measuring about five inches high, the head had bounced between different university museum displays until the 1980s.
<seg id="17">	In the late 1970s, the university loaned it to director John Huston to use as a prop in his 1979 comedy Wise Blood, based on the Flannery O’Connor novel.
<seg id="18">	O’Connor had lived near Macon, and the movie was filmed nearby.
<seg id="19">	The Mercer scientists also determined the head had come from Ecuador.
<seg id="20">	An Army Air Force officer named James Harrison had collected it in 1942, long before the establishment of regulations meant to stop the trafficking of cultural artifacts and human remains.
<seg id="21">	“It was Indiana Jones,” Kiefer said.
<seg id="22">	“When this was collected, science was different, everything was new… but almost 80 years later, we recognize its cultural importance, along with the science.”
<seg id="23">	Tsantsas were created from the severed heads of vanquished foes.
<seg id="24">	Victors removed the skull, brain, and facial muscles before sewing the eyes and lips shut.
<seg id="25">	They then molded the skin as it dried and shrunk.
<seg id="26">	These war trophies were meant to trap the spirit of the enemy and give power to his killer.
<seg id="27">	“Anyway, they had two shrunken human heads,” Harrison, who later became a biology professor at Mercer University, wrote in his memoirs.
<seg id="28">	“I badly wanted one of those heads and by motions and gestures got the idea across.”
<seg id="29">	He traded some coins, a pocket knife, and a military insignia for the tsantsa.
<seg id="30">	Eighty years later, scientists at Mercer University reached out to Ecuadorian officials for guidance on what to do.
<seg id="31">	After contacting the Ecuadorian Embassy, the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, and the National Cultural Heritage Institute, the Mercer scientists agreed to first authenticate the artifact.
<seg id="32">	Doing so was easier said than done.
<seg id="33">	Europeans had developed a fascination for the tsantsa in the 1850s.
<seg id="34">	As a result, people in the Amazon produced shrunken heads without any ceremonial value.
<seg id="35">	So, Byron and Keifer used a checklist of 33 criteria to determine the shrunken head’s authenticity.
<seg id="36">	They studied skin attributes like color, density, and texture as well as the structure of the facial features.
<seg id="37">	They also looked for signs of traditional fabrication like traces of charcoal in the head cavity and a hole at the top of the head for attaching a cord.
<seg id="38">	By the end of their study, they were satisfied that they had an authentic tsantsa.
<seg id="39">	“Most checklist indicators of authenticity (30/33) affirm that the Mercer tsantsa is ceremonial,” their paper explained.
<seg id="40">	In addition to evidence like head lice, the scientists also found marks in the skin left by the person who had first made the tsantsa.
<seg id="41">	“You can even see where fingers and thumbs would have been used to hold and ‘work’ the skin during the shrinking process,” Byron said.
<seg id="42">	After they authenticated the tsantsa, Ecuador agreed to take the artifact back.
<seg id="43">	But the Mercer scientists aren’t sure what happened to the shrunken head after that.
<seg id="44">	“It’s not our decision to make, where this cultural artifact ends up,” said Kiefer.
<seg id="45">	“Our job was to make sure that it was reunited with people who know more about the culture and the context, to make the appropriate decision on how to display this.”
