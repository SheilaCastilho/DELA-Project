<seg id="3">	Congressperson Ocasio-Cortez’s outrage over a Republican lawmaker’s verbal assault broadened into an extraordinary moment on the House floor on Thursday as she and other Democrats assailed a sexist culture of “accepting violence and violent language against women” whose adherents include Donald Trump.
<seg id="4">	A day after rejecting an offer of contrition from Republican congressperson Ted Yoho for his language during this week’s Capitol steps confrontation, Ocasio-Cortez and more than a dozen colleagues cast the incident as all-too-common behavior by men, including the president and other Republicans.
<seg id="5">	“This issue is not about one incident. It is cultural,” said congressperson.	gender	congressperson=feminine
<seg id="6">	She called it a culture “of accepting a violence and violent language against women, an entire structure of power that supports that”.	X	X
<seg id="7">	The remarkable outpouring, with several female lawmakers saying they had routinely encountered such treatment, came in an election year in which polls show women lean decisively against Trump, who has a history of mocking women.	X	X
<seg id="8">	Trump was captured in a 2005 tape boasting about physically abusing them, and his disparagement of the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, has included calling her “crazy”.	gender	them=feminine
<seg id="9">	The lawmakers joining Ocasio-Cortez represented a wide range of the chamber’s Democrats, underscoring the party’s unity over an issue that can energize their party’s voters.	X	X
<seg id="10">	No Republicans spoke.	X	X
<seg id="11">	But the House minority leader, Kevin McCarthy, at a separate appearance defended Yoho, 65, one of his party’s most conservative members and who will retire in January.	X	X
<seg id="12">	“When someone apologizes they should be forgiven,” McCarthy said.	X	X
<seg id="13">	He added later: “I just think in a new world, in a new age, we now determine whether we accept when someone says I’m sorry if it’s a good enough apology.”	X	X

<seg id="21">	In an encounter on Monday witnessed by a reporter from the Hill, Yoho berated Ocasio-Cortez on the House steps for saying that some of the increased crime during the coronavirus pandemic could be traced to rising unemployment and poverty.	lexical ambiguity	house steps=stages/footsteps vs stairs in the congress
<seg id="22">	Ocasio-Cortez, a freshman who has made a mark as one of Congress’s most outspoken progressives, described it on the House floor on Thursday.	gender	freshman=feminine	gender	one of=feminine	gender	outspoken=feminine
<seg id="23">	She said Yoho put his finger in her face and called her disgusting, crazy and dangerous.	X	X
<seg id="24">	She also told the House that in front of reporters, he called her, “and I quote, ‘a fucking bitch’”.	X	X
<seg id="25">	That matched the Hill’s version of what Yoho had said.	X	X
<seg id="26">	Ocasio-Cortez was not there for that remark.	X	X
<seg id="27">	Ocasio-Cortez said Yoho’s references to his wife and daughters as he explained his actions during brief remarks on Wednesday actually underscored the problem.	X	X
<seg id="28">	“Having a daughter does not make a man decent.	X	X
<seg id="29">	Having a wife does not make a decent man.	X	X

<seg id="4">	The most important thing you need to understand about the role Arm processor architecture plays in any computing or communications market -- smartphones, personal computers, servers, or otherwise -- is this: Arm Holdings, Ltd., which is based in Cambridge, UK, designs the components of processors for others to build.	X	X
<seg id="5">	Arm owns these designs, along with the architecture of their instruction sets, such as 64-bit ARM64.	X	X

<seg id="8">	How does Arm, a chip company, conduct business without making chips?	lexical ambiguity	arm=limb vs named entity (ARM)	lexical ambiguity	chips=fried potatos vs microchips
<seg id="9">	Arm Holdings, Ltd. does not manufacture its own chips.	lexical ambiguity	chips=fried potatos vs microchips
<seg id="10">	It has no fabrication facilities of its own.	X	X
<seg id="11">	Instead, it licenses these rights to other companies, which Arm Holdings calls "partners."	X	X
<seg id="12">	They utilize Arm's architectural model as a kind of template, building systems that use Arm cores as their central processors.	X	X
<seg id="13">	These Arm partners are given the opportunity to design, and possibly manufacture, their systems around these processors, or else outsource their production to others, but in any event sell implementations of these designs in commercial markets.	lexical ambiguity	arm=limb vs named entity (ARM)
<seg id="14">	Many Samsung and Apple smartphones and tablets, and essentially all devices produced by Qualcomm, utilize some Arm intellectual property.	X	X
<seg id="15">	A new wave of servers produced with Arm-based systems-on-a-chip (SoC) has already made headway in competing against x86, especially with low-power or special-use models.	lexical ambiguity	arm=limb vs named entity (ARM)

<seg id="17">	WHY X86 IS SOLD AND ARM IS LICENSED	lexical ambiguity	arm=limb vs named entity (ARM)
<seg id="18">	The maker of an Intel- or AMD-based x86 computer does not design nor does it own any portion of the intellectual property for the CPU.	X	X
<seg id="19">	It also cannot reproduce x86 IP for its own purposes.	X	X
<seg id="20">	Intel Inside is a seal certifying a license for the device manufacturer to build a machine around Intel's processor.	X	X
<seg id="21">	An Arm-based device may be designed to incorporate the processor, perhaps even making adaptations to its architecture and functionality.	lexical ambiguity	arm=limb vs named entity (ARM)
<seg id="22">	Since Arm has no interest in marketing itself to end users, you don't typically hear much about "Arm Inside."	X	X

<seg id="27">	In its place, in Mac laptop units that are reportedly already shipping, will be a new system-on-a-chip called A12Z, code-named "Bionic," produced by Apple using 64-bit component designs licensed to it by Arm Holdings, Ltd.	X	X
<seg id="28">	In this case, Arm isn't the designer, but the producer of the instruction set around which Apple makes its original design.	X	X
<seg id="29">	In December 2020, Apple chose Taiwan-based TSMC as the fabricator for its A12Z.	X	X
<seg id="30">	For MacOS 11 to continue to run software compiled for Intel processors, under an Arm SoC, the new system will run a kind of "just-in-time" instruction translator called Rosetta 2.	lexical ambiguity	arm=limb vs named entity (ARM)
<seg id="31">	Rather than run an old MacOS image in a virtual machine, the new OS will run a live x86 machine code translator that re-fashions x86 code into what Apple now calls Universal 2 binary code -- an intermediate-level code that can still be made to run on older Intel-based Macs -- in real-time.	X	X
<seg id="32">	That code will run in what sources outside of Apple call an "emulator," but which isn't really an emulator in that it doesn't simulate the execution of code in an actual, physical machine (there is no "Universal 2" chip).	X	X

<seg id="7">	As manufacturers continue to lower the cost of wind turbines and components, wind energy may soon compete cost-wise with conventional energy sources.	X	X
<seg id="8">	Thanks largely to virtual prototyping and physical prototype testing, engineers are moving closer to that goal.	X	X
<seg id="9">	But there's a problem when it comes to simulating wind turbines.	X	X
<seg id="10">	Complex aerodynamic effects and large deflections are at work.	lexical ambiguity	at work=being present at work vs in action
<seg id="11">	And the electrical systems are sophisticated and difficult to model.	X	X
<seg id="12">	Physical prototype testing is no walk in the park either.	X	X
<seg id="13">	The source of the power for field tests is, of course, the wind, which can't be controlled.	X	X
<seg id="14">	Also, modern wind turbines are huge, which means facilities for full-scale testing must be supersized, too.	X	X
<seg id="15">	To overcome these obstacles, other countries have developed strategies that could serve as blueprints to help the U.S.	X	X
<seg id="16">	Spain, for example, is a global leader in installed capacity and wind-turbine manufacturing.	X	X
<seg id="17">	The Spanish Centre for Renewable Energy (Cener) is currently building an innovative test center dedicated to developing wind energy.	X	X

<seg id="40">	The standardized shape of wind turbines is evidence of the industry's relative maturity.	X	X

<seg id="32">	Sharon Schneider, the editor in chief of PetaPixel, a photography and camera news website, had a similar theory.	X	X

<seg id="34">	Wide-angle lenses make objects closer to the camera appear to be much larger than objects that are even just a tiny bit farther away.	X	X

<seg id="42">	“Wide-angle lenses have this angle no matter how optically correct they are,” Mrs. Schneider said, adding that these sorts of optical distortions can be fixed in post production.	X	X
<seg id="43">	But while editing the photo may have made it look more realistic, that would be frowned upon, said Doug Mills, a photographer assigned to the Washington bureau of The New York Times.	X	X
<seg id="44">	Mr. Mills was outside the Carters’ home during the photo session and saw the flash go off inside.	lexical ambiguity	go off=explode vs shoot/fire

<seg id="47">	“That would be completely forbidden,” Mr. Mills said.	X	X
<seg id="48">	Official White House photographers are supposed to abide by ethical rules similar to those followed by photojournalists, he said.	X	X

<seg id="11">	“This is not an oddity — this is somebody’s body, this is somebody’s culture, and it’s not ours,” said Mercer University chemist Mary Kiefer, one of the article’s co-authors.	X	X
<seg id="12">	“So from our perspective, repatriation was essential, and we were very lucky that our university supported this endeavor.”	X	X
<seg id="13">	After years in storage, the head was first rediscovered by Keifer’s co-author, a Mercer biologist named Joan Byron.	X	X
<seg id="14">	Byron, overseeing the transfer of various taxidermy specimens to a new science building, realized that the Ecuadorian shrunken head needed a second look.	X	X
<seg id="15">	Byron and her colleagues didn’t know much about the head, but started piecing its story together.	X	X
<seg id="16">	Measuring about five inches high, the head had bounced between different university museum displays until the 1980s.	X	X
<seg id="17">	In the late 1970s, the university loaned it to director John Huston to use as a prop in his 1979 comedy Wise Blood, based on the Flannery O’Connor novel.	reference	it=the head	gender	it=feminine
<seg id="18">	O’Connor had lived near Macon, and the movie was filmed nearby.	X	X
<seg id="19">	The Mercer scientists also determined the head had come from Ecuador.	gender	scientists=feminine
<seg id="20">	An Army Air Force officer named James Harrison had collected it in 1942, long before the establishment of regulations meant to stop the trafficking of cultural artifacts and human remains.	reference	it=the head	gender	it=feminine
<seg id="21">	“It was Indiana Jones,” Kiefer said.	X	X
<seg id="22">	“When this was collected, science was different, everything was new… but almost 80 years later, we recognize its cultural importance, along with the science.”	reference	this=the head	gender	this=feminine	gender	collected=feminine
<seg id="23">	Tsantsas were created from the severed heads of vanquished foes.	X	X
<seg id="24">	Victors removed the skull, brain, and facial muscles before sewing the eyes and lips shut.	X	X
<seg id="25">	They then molded the skin as it dried and shrunk.	X	X
<seg id="26">	These war trophies were meant to trap the spirit of the enemy and give power to his killer.	X	X
<seg id="27">	“Anyway, they had two shrunken human heads,” Harrison, who later became a biology professor at Mercer University, wrote in his memoirs.	X	X
<seg id="28">	“I badly wanted one of those heads and by motions and gestures got the idea across.”	X	X
<seg id="29">	He traded some coins, a pocket knife, and a military insignia for the tsantsa.	X	X
<seg id="30">	Eighty years later, scientists at Mercer University reached out to Ecuadorian officials for guidance on what to do.	gender	scientists=feminine
<seg id="31">	After contacting the Ecuadorian Embassy, the Ministry of Cultural Affairs, and the National Cultural Heritage Institute, the Mercer scientists agreed to first authenticate the artifact.	gender	scientists=feminine
<seg id="32">	Doing so was easier said than done.	X	X
<seg id="33">	Europeans had developed a fascination for the tsantsa in the 1850s.	X	X
<seg id="34">	As a result, people in the Amazon produced shrunken heads without any ceremonial value.	X	X
<seg id="35">	So, Byron and Keifer used a checklist of 33 criteria to determine the shrunken head’s authenticity.	X	X
<seg id="36">	They studied skin attributes like color, density, and texture as well as the structure of the facial features.	gender	they=feminine
<seg id="37">	They also looked for signs of traditional fabrication like traces of charcoal in the head cavity and a hole at the top of the head for attaching a cord.	gender	they=feminine
<seg id="38">	By the end of their study, they were satisfied that they had an authentic tsantsa.	gender	they=feminine	gender	satisfied=feminine	gender	they=feminine
<seg id="39">	“Most checklist indicators of authenticity (30/33) affirm that the Mercer tsantsa is ceremonial,” their paper explained.	gender	their=feminine	lexical ambiguity	paper=a sheet of paper vs essay / research
<seg id="40">	In addition to evidence like head lice, the scientists also found marks in the skin left by the person who had first made the tsantsa.	X	X
<seg id="41">	“You can even see where fingers and thumbs would have been used to hold and ‘work’ the skin during the shrinking process,” Byron said.	X	X
<seg id="42">	After they authenticated the tsantsa, Ecuador agreed to take the artifact back.	X	X
<seg id="43">	But the Mercer scientists aren’t sure what happened to the shrunken head after that.	gender	scientists=feminine
<seg id="44">	“It’s not our decision to make, where this cultural artifact ends up,” said Kiefer.	X	X
<seg id="45">	“Our job was to make sure that it was reunited with people who know more about the culture and the context, to make the appropriate decision on how to display this.”	reference	it=head	gender	it=feminine
