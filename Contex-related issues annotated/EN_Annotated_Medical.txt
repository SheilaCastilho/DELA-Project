<seg id="16">	Between 2 and 4 in 100 women get PMS that is severe enough to prevent them from getting on with their daily lives.	X	X

<seg id="18">	If you have questions about this, you should discuss it with your healthcare professional and see the Further information section below.	X	X
<seg id="19">	What causes PMS?	X	X
<seg id="20">	The exact cause of PMS is not known.	X	X
<seg id="21">	It could be linked to changes in the levels of your hormones and body chemicals.	reference	it = PMS	gender	linked to=feminine 
<seg id="22">	The levels of your hormones change during your menstrual cycle.	X	X
<seg id="23">	Some women are more sensitive to these hormonal changes, which can lead to the symptoms described.	X	X
<seg id="24">	Women who use some forms of hormonal contraception are less affected by PMS.	X	X
<seg id="25">	PMS has also been linked to a variety of chemical substances in your blood called neurotransmitters, such as serotonin and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA).	X	X
<seg id="26">	How do I know I have PMS?	X	X
<seg id="27">	If you are getting symptoms, you should write them down in a diary for at least two menstrual cycles in a row.	X	X
<seg id="28">	Your healthcare professional will then review your diary with you to see whether your symptoms fit the pattern of PMS.	X	X
<seg id="29">	If your symptom diary alone is not enough for diagnosis, you may be offered treatment with gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues for a period of 3 months.	X	X
<seg id="30">	This will temporarily stop your ovaries producing hormones, which may help with your diagnosis.	X	X
<seg id="31">	What are my options?	X	X
<seg id="32">	There is a wide range of options to help you to manage your symptoms and allow you to get on with your daily life.	gender	help you=feminine		
<seg id="33">	Your healthcare professional will discuss these with you.	X	X
<seg id="34">	Whatever option you choose, you will be advised to continue to keep a diary of your symptoms for at least another 2–3 months, as this can help to see whether a particular treatment is working.	gender	advised=feminine

<seg id="45">	It can help you learn new ways of managing some of your symptoms to reduce their impact on your daily life.	gender	help you=feminine 
<seg id="46">	Complementary therapy	X	X
<seg id="47">	There are several alternative or complementary therapies for PMS.	X	X
<seg id="48">	Many women find these helpful, although there is little evidence to show that they are effective.	X	X
<seg id="49">	You should inform your healthcare professional if you are taking any medicine or supplement.	X	X
<seg id="50">	This is because some complementary therapies may react with other medicines.	X	X
<seg id="51">	Supplements of calcium, vitamin D, Vitex agnus-castus (a herb known as chasteberry) or Ginkgo biloba may be helpful.	X	X
<seg id="52">	Evening primrose oil can reduce breast tenderness.	X	X
<seg id="53">	Medical treatment	X	X
<seg id="54">	Non-hormonal	X	X
<seg id="55">	Two types of antidepressant medications have been shown to help PMS symptoms, namely selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin–noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).	X	X
<seg id="56">	Antidepressants should only be prescribed by a healthcare professional.	X	X
<seg id="57">	These can be taken on a daily basis for 2 weeks before your period or all the way through your cycle.	X	X
<seg id="58">	Side effects may include nausea (feeling sick), insomnia (difficulty sleeping), tiredness and low libido (not being interested in having sex).	X	X
<seg id="59">	SSRIs are recommended as one of the first-choice treatments for severe PMS.	X	X
<seg id="60">	If you choose to stop taking antidepressants, it is important that you do so gradually so that you do not get withdrawal symptoms, such as headaches.	X	X
<seg id="61">	Your healthcare team will advise you.	gender	you=feminine
<seg id="62">	If you are planning a pregnancy or if you get pregnant, you should talk to your healthcare professional before stopping any medication.	X	X

<seg id="64">	Hormonal	X	X
<seg id="65">	Combined oral contraceptive pill	X	X
<seg id="66">	Some women find using the combined oral contraceptive pill helps with PMS symptoms.	X	X
<seg id="67">	 Newer types of contraceptive pills containing a progestogen called drospirenone have been shown to improve PMS symptoms.	X	X
<seg id="68">	These are considered as first-choice treatments.	X	X
<seg id="69">	You may be advised to take these pills continuously, without a break, for better symptom control.	gender	advised=feminine
<seg id="70">	Estrogen hormone patches or gel	X	X
<seg id="71">	Using estrogen hormone patches or gel can improve the physical and psychological symptoms of PMS.	X	X
<seg id="72">	Unless you have had a hysterectomy (removal of your uterus), estrogen hormone patches or gel must be used in combination with a low dose of the hormone progestogen to prevent abnormal thickening of the lining of your womb.	X	X
<seg id="73">	Progestogens may be given in the form of tablets (taken for a minimum of 10 days each month), pessaries or a hormone-containing coil.	lexical ambiguity	coil=reel vs intrauterine device
<seg id="74">	Estrogen hormone patches or gel do not work as a contraceptive and so you will still need to use a method of birth control.	X	X		
<seg id="75">	Danazol	X	X
<seg id="76">	Danazol (a synthetic hormone) in low doses can sometimes be used in the second half of your menstrual cycle to reduce breast tenderness.	X	X
<seg id="77">	However, your healthcare professional should discuss with you the potential permanent side effects, such as deepening of your voice and enlargement of your clitoris.	X	X
<seg id="78">	It is important to use contraception while using danazol because it can affect the development of a female baby in the uterus.	X	X
<seg id="79">	Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues	X	X
<seg id="80">	GnRH analogues may be recommended if you have severe PMS symptoms and when other treatments have not worked or are not suitable.	X	X
<seg id="81">	These may also be used to help reach a diagnosis in some women, as mentioned in the How do I know I have PMS? section above.	X	X
<seg id="82">	These medicines cause a temporary and reversible menopause, so you will not release eggs and you will not have any periods.	X	X
<seg id="83">	If you use GnRH analogues for more than 6 months, it may affect your bone strength (osteoporosis).	X	X
<seg id="84">	You will be advised to take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to protect your bones and reduce your menopausal symptoms, such as hot flushes.	X	X
<seg id="85">	You will be advised to have regular bone density scans to check for osteoporosis if you use this treatment for more than 2 years.	gender	you will be advised=feminine
<seg id="86">	You should also make sure that you get regular exercise, have a balanced diet and do not smoke.	X	X
<seg id="87">	Surgical treatment	X	X
<seg id="88">	Your healthcare professional will only suggest surgical treatment if you have severe symptoms and all other treatments have not helped.	X	X
<seg id="89">	Removal of your uterus along with both ovaries and fallopian tubes can help to improve severe PMS symptoms by making you menopausal.	X	X
<seg id="90">	If you have surgical treatment for PMS, you may be advised to use HRT to prevent menopausal symptoms. If your uterus and ovaries have been removed, this will be estrogen-only HRT. If you still have your uterus, you will need both estrogen and progestogen. Progestogens protect the lining of your uterus, but may then re-introduce symptoms of PMS. See the RCOG patient information Treatment for symptoms of the menopause.	X	X
<seg id="91">	If you are considering surgical treatment, your healthcare professional will advise you to use GnRH analogues and HRT for 3–6 months before surgery. GnRH analogues have a similar effect on your hormones as having your ovaries removed and will give you an idea of how you may feel after the operation. You may also be able to see whether you will benefit from surgery and whether HRT suits you.	X	X
<seg id="92">	Surgical treatment such as endometrial ablation or hysterectomy without removal of both ovaries is not recommended for treatment of PMS.	X	X
<seg id="93">	See the RCOG patient information Laparoscopic hysterectomy, Vaginal hysterectomy, Abdominal hysterectomy and Endometrial ablation.	X	X
<seg id="94">	At what stage of treatment should I be referred to a gynaecologist?	X	X
<seg id="95">	If simple measures such as combined pills or SSRIs have not worked, your GP will refer you to a specialist.	X	X
<seg id="96">	 A team of healthcare professionals may be involved in your care, including your GP, a nurse specialist, a dietician, a mental health professional (psychiatrist, clinical psychologist or counsellor) and a gynaecologist.	gender	you=feminine
<seg id="97">	The make-up of the team will depend on the hospital you attend.	X	X
