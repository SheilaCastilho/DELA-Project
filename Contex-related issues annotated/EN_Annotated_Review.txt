<seg id="2">	Instructions are bare bones, but the air fryer is wonderful!	lexical ambiguity	bare bones=naked bones (literal translation) vs basic
<seg id="3">	Reviewed in the United States on November 1, 2019	X	X
<seg id="4">	First off, my apologies for being late in posting this review.	X	X
<seg id="5">	I received this fryer about a week or so ago but didn't know what to make with it because . . . I had NEVER used an air fryer before.	X	X
<seg id="6">	Also, this particular model DOES NOT COME WITH RECIPES!	X	X
<seg id="7">	Nothing, zilch, nada!	X	X
<seg id="8">	You pretty much have to look for your recipes online because the Instant Vortex will not provide you with any.	X	X
<seg id="9">	They will give you a very broad time and heat guide but that's it.	X	X
<seg id="10">	In fact, my main complaint with this air fryer is mainly on the bare-bones instructions.	lexical ambiguity	bare bones=naked bones (literal translation) vs basic
<seg id="11">	For that reason, a lot of what you do with this air fryer is going to have to be through trial and error.	X	X
<seg id="12">	There are more instructions to prevent you from lighting your house on fire than there are in the operation of the machine.	X	X
<seg id="13">	So, as someone who has never used an air fryer before, especially an Instant Vortex Plus 6 Quart 6-in-1 thingamajig, what did I think of it?	X	X
<seg id="14">	AWESOME!	gender	awesome=feminine
<seg id="15">	But before we get to why it's awesome, I need to tell you what you're going to get when you purchase this device.	reference it=air fryer	gender	awesome=feminine
<seg id="16">	THINGS TO KNOW BEFORE PURCHASING:	X	X
<seg id="17">	1.) Most timers (at least in the US) when they are 00:00 it means 00 mins : 00 seconds.	X	X
<seg id="18">	Not so with this air fryer.	X	X
<seg id="19">	With the Instant Vortex the first two digits are hours and the last two digits are minutes.	X	X
<seg id="20">	This was not clear in the instruction manual.	X	X
<seg id="21">	Remember, I've never used an air fryer before, so this was new to me.	X	X
<seg id="22">	2.) When using air fryer mode, at around 3 quarters time, the fryer will ask you to turn over your food.	X	X
<seg id="23">	This was also not very clear in the instructions.	X	X
<seg id="24">	3.) The basket is SMALL and not ideal for party size servings.	X	X
<seg id="25">	Six quarts is good for a couple, but anyone with a big family is going to find themselves running multiple batches to get enough food cooked.	lexical ambiguity	run=move fast on foot vs operate
<seg id="26">	If you're planning a big super bowl wing fest, you might want to get something bigger.	lexical ambiguity	super bowl=big bowl vs Named Entity 
<seg id="27">	BONUS: The air fryer DOES NOT get dangerously hot like an oven.	X	X
<seg id="28">	You can accidentally touch the top of the fryer and not burn your hand off.	X	X
<seg id="29">	The vent in the back is also warm but not blazing hot.	X	X
<seg id="30">	As long as the safety instructions are followed, this machine feels very safe to use.	X	X
<seg id="31">	Somehow we didn't blow a fuse when using the microwave and the air fryer at the same time, so that was also impressive, but your results may vary.	X	X
<seg id="32">	All right, so let's get into exactly how I used my air fryer as someone who has never, ever used one before.	X	X
<seg id="33">	- We added pepper and salt to the raw wings.	X	X
<seg id="34">	Then we greased the tray and basket with Pam cooking oil.	X	X
<seg id="35">	EDIT: (Don't grease the tray with PAM.	X	X
<seg id="36">	You can spray your food not your tray.	X	X
<seg id="37">	Or use a substitute instead of PAM.)	X	X
<seg id="38">	- We found an online recipe that was for 24 minutes.	X	X
<seg id="39">	At the twelve minute mark we flip over the wings and cook the other side.	X	X
<seg id="40">	- After putting the food into the tray and setting the fryer for 12 minutes, we quickly discovered that the fryer must PREHEAT first.	X	X
<seg id="41">	After it ran through its preheat cycle, then it said "ADD FOOD."	reference it=air fryer	gender	it=feminine
<seg id="42">	Whoops.	X	X
<seg id="43">	The wings stayed in there anyway.	X	X
<seg id="44">	- At around 5 minutes, the fryer then said "TURN FOOD OVER."	X	X
<seg id="45">	We didn't know it was going to give us this prompt.	reference it=air fryer	gender	it=feminine
<seg id="46">	So we took out the basket to check on the wings, they were cooking but not yet finished, so we flipped them over.
<seg id="47">	- Once the timer was finished, we removed the basket and saw that the wings were halfway cooked, awesome!	X	X
<seg id="48">	We popped them back in for another 12 minutes but made note that in the future, we just put them in for 24 and wait for the fryer to tell us when to flip.	reference	them=wings	gender	them=feminine
<seg id="49">	Also, not once did I feel a blast of hot air like I do when taking things out of the oven.	X	X
<seg id="50">	The fryer and the basket felt safe to handle AT ALL TIMES.	X	X
<seg id="51">	- After another twelve minutes it was time to taste test.	X	X
<seg id="52">	Did the wings cook thoroughly or were we about to get a case of salmonella?	X	X
<seg id="53">	- The answer was YES!	X	X
<seg id="54">	The wings cooked thoroughly.	X	X
<seg id="55">	The exterior skin was nice and crunchy while the inside was juicy and flavorful.	X	X
<seg id="56">	All of the excess oil dripped off of the wings and settled at the bottom of the basket.	X	X
<seg id="57">	Awesome!	X	X
<seg id="58">	- Clean up required dumping out the remaining oil into a bag, then cleaning the basket and grill with paper towels and water.	X	X
<seg id="59">	THEN WE TRIED COOKING SALMON USING THE BAKE SETTING.	X	X
<seg id="60">	- Grease the grill with pam.	X	X
<seg id="61">	EDIT: DO NOT GREASE THE GRILL WITH PAM.	X	X
<seg id="62">	You can put PAM on your food but not the grill tray.	X	X
<seg id="63">	Supposedly this starts to erode some of the coating on the tray.	X	X
<seg id="64">	Whoops!	X	X
<seg id="65">	Found this out recently.	X	X
<seg id="66">	- Pop 1.6lbs of Salmon into the basket.	X	X
<seg id="67">	(This time we waited for the preheat)	X	X
<seg id="68">	- Cooked for 7 minutes at 389 I believe.	X	X
<seg id="69">	Don't remember.	X	X
<seg id="70">	- Took the salmon out and found that the interior was still raw.	X	X
<seg id="71">	Whoops.	X	X
<seg id="72">	Again, no recipes means we don't know what the heck we're doing with this thing.	X	X
<seg id="73">	Pop it back in for another 7 minutes.	X	X
<seg id="74">	- Salmon bakes and is now thoroughly cooked.	X	X
<seg id="75">	Still good, still flavorful, but we underestimated cooking time.	X	X
<seg id="76">	WHAT ABOUT THE BROIL, ROAST, REHEAT & DEHYDRATE FEATURE?	X	X
<seg id="77">	I, unfortunately, do not know.	X	X
<seg id="78">	We haven't really roasted, broiled, or dehydrated food in my house.	X	X
<seg id="79">	However, if the chicken wings and salmon are the standard it sets, then I'm sure those features will work perfectly.	reference	it=the air fryer	gender	it=feminine
<seg id="80">	In fact, I have to say that I am supremely impressed with the Instant Vortex 6-in-1 multi use fryer.	X	X
<seg id="81">	It's extremely safe t use, It cooks the food thoroughly, and it's super easy to clean.	reference	it=air fryer	gender	it=feminine	gender	safe=feminine
<seg id="82">	If you're looking for an air fryer with the versatility of an oven but without the hassle or increase to your gas bill, than this air fryer is definitely going to be a perfect fit for you!	X	X
<seg id="83">	Very, very happy with this device and I can't wait to fry more food with it.	reference	it=air fryer	gender	it=feminine
<seg id="84">	HIGHLY RECOMMEND!	X	X

<seg id="4">	While this gift was adored by it's 6 year old recipient, as a mother, I can't help but mention the fact that it is very TYPICAL Barbie.	gender 	recipient=feminine
<seg id="5">	I joked with my friend that it was "Grey's Anatomy Doctor Barbie"- a very sexy Dr. Barbie in her short dress and high heeled shoes.
<seg id="6">	Granted, the shoes are wedge (I myself prefer wedge to stiletto, much more practical in the echelon of heels), but I've never actually seen a Dr. in a hot pink micro mini wearing 5" hot pink wedges before, well, except maybe in the movies... you know, THOSE movies.	gender	Dr=feminine
<seg id="7">	And the baby that I thought looked so cute online, that comes with this set? 	X	X
<seg id="8">	I penned it, "Emaciated Premie Barbie Baby".	X	X
<seg id="9">	I mean seriously, Mattel, can't you AT LEAST make a nice fat, round baby for your Barbie line?	X	X
<seg id="10">	Does even the BABY have to be unusually long and thin?	X	X
<seg id="11">	 I've never seen a healthy baby that looks like this one.	X	X
<seg id="12">	And as you read this, consumer, I'm sure you're wondering why I didn't notice this BEFORE ordering it?	X	X
<seg id="13">	And to that I confess that as a parent purchasing a Barbie, I was really searching for the lesser of two evils.	gender	parent=feminine
<seg id="14">	I thought perhaps it was better than say, Roller Blade Barbie in her short, short hot pants with her pink hair, etc?	X	X
<seg id="15">	 But maybe I was wrong.	gender	wrong=feminine
<seg id="16">	Anyway, my daughter loved it, and her best friend loved it, and her best friend's mom & I had a really good laugh about it.	X	X
<seg id="17">	It also sparked a very healthy conversation with the girls about how unrealistic Barbie's body is, and her clothing, and the baby... and how it's all just a "fantasy", etc. 	X	X
<seg id="18">	Good luck in purchasing!	X	X

<seg id="3">	I really liked this waffle maker after receiving it.	X	X
<seg id="4">	I felt it was designed well and is highly functional and easy to use.	reference	it=waffle maker	gender	it=feminine	gender	well designed=feminine
<seg id="5">	I make 2 waffles twice every weekend with this Cusinart WAF-F20 and have been doing so for the last 10 months with great success.	X	X
<seg id="6">	I really liked it.	reference	it=waffle maker
<seg id="7">	Then, one weekend after cleanup, I looked at the rear support post and stared for awhile and asked myself "What an I looking at?"	X	X
<seg id="8">	I was dumbfound.	gender	dumbfound=feminine
<seg id="9">	The entire housing of this unit's rear support post is made from cheap plastic.	X	X
<seg id="10">	Plastic!	X	X
<seg id="11">	The center section, which has two sets of coils, one for the upper and one for the lower griddle portion get extremely hot and is within 1 inch of that rear post.	X	X
<seg id="12">	Cheap plastic and heat just don't get along.	X	X
<seg id="13">	Cheap plastic easily warps, swells, and weakens with heat.	X	X
<seg id="14">	Now add to this the ever-so-slight "torque" that's applied every time you turn the unit on its pivot and it hits the stop.	X	X
<seg id="15">	This heat on plastic, plus the torque, plus 10 months of use, and the entire rear support post split wide open, exposing the gearing mechanism and the wiring (see the Michael Clark review and pictures).	X	X
<seg id="16">	With great frustration, I have been in contact with Conair numerous times for a warranty replacement, and nearly a month later, still don't have the replacement unit.	X	X
<seg id="17">	Their customer service seems to need a regular kick in the pants to get moving.	lexical ambiguity	kick in the pants=a kick in the pant (literal translation) vs a wake up call
<seg id="18">	So be aware, this unit requires you use "kid gloves" when operating it.	X	X
<seg id="19">	Don't clean the unit until it is completely cool and the plastic has firmed back up, and resist applying torque when pivoting the unit, especially when hot.	X	X
<seg id="20">	I'm disappointed. 	gender	disappointed=feminine

<seg id="2">	Another great classic Nicktoon from Shout Factory	X	X
<seg id="3">	Reviewed in the United States on August 10, 2011	X	X
<seg id="4">	Hey Arnold is a Nickelodeon cartoon series that originally ran for five seasons from 1996 to 2004.	X	X
<seg id="5">	This DVD box set from Shout Factory contains the first 20 episodes of the series.	X	X
<seg id="6">	The series was created by Craig Bartlett and depicts the life of title character Arnold and his interactions with his quirky classmates and bizarre neighbors in the large nameless city in which they all live.	X	X
<seg id="7">	It is well known for skillfully mixing comedy with some dramatic moments as well as for devoting at least an episode or two to even the most minor of characters throughout its run.	reference	It=the series	gender	it=feminine gender  known=feminine
<seg id="8">	It also has a fantastic jazzy soundtrack.	reference	It=the series	gender	it=feminine
<seg id="9">	The animation improved greatly over the 5 seasons of the series, and the first season is notably rougher than later seasons, but it is by no means bad, simply a product of its time.	lexical ambiguity	rougher=violent vs not well made
<seg id="10">	This DVD is the general retail release of Season 1.	X	X
<seg id="11">	This season was previously released as an Amazon exclusive Media on Demand (MOD) set burned to order and available for a relatively high price.	lexical ambiguity	burned=be on fire vs  recorded
<seg id="12">	The retail set has a much more professional feel to it, it comes packaged in a clear case with some nice art on the inside, as opposed to the standard issue black case that the previous release used.	X	X
<seg id="13">	Additionally, the previous release had silent menus while this new set has the show's theme song playing in the background.	X	X
<seg id="14">	The old set also had some compatibility issues related to the nature of the product; being burned on demand onto DVD-R discs led to complaints about the discs not being playable on certain players.	X	X
<seg id="15">	While I personally never experienced that issue with any of the MOD sets, this new set should be free of those problems regardless.	X	X
<seg id="16">	This release contains NO extras whatsoever.	lexical ambiguity	release=communication vs version
<seg id="17">	Personally, this doesn't bother me as I usually use DVD extras once, at most.	X	X
<seg id="18">	I understand that some people fully expect all DVDs to have extras, but for me, it just isn't that big of a problem.	X	X
<seg id="19">	The episodes are here, and in the end that's what the fans have been waiting for.	X	X
<seg id="20">	Overall, this is a quality release of the complete first season and overlooking the lack of anything but the episodes themselves fans should be happy to finally see this series come to DVD.	X	X
<seg id="21">	This is the fourth Nickelodeon release from Shout Factory, following the first seasons of The Wild Thornberrys, Rocko's Modern Life, and Hey Dude.	X	X
<seg id="22">	Several more are planned for the rest of the year, including The Angry Beavers Seasons 1 & 2, Danny Phantom Season 1, Aaahh!! Real Monsters Season 1, Catdog Season 1 Part 1 and The Wild Thornberrys Season 2 Part 1.	X	X
<seg id="23">	So far I feel like Shout Factory is doing a great job with these sets and I hope their partnership with Nickelodeon can continue for years to come.	X	X
<seg id="24">	Note: All five seasons of Hey Arnold were at one time available from Amazon.	X	X
<seg id="25">	Those seasons are the older MOD releases, and seasons 2-5 have NOT been announced or released by Shout Factory.	X	X
<seg id="26">	As of July 16, 2011 the older MOD releases have been discontinued, however they may still be available through third party sellers.	X	X
<seg id="27">	Additional Note: Many of the reviews on this page refer to the old MOD release of season 1.	X	X
<seg id="28">	The episodes on this release are the same, however the reviews of the quality of the product itself seen here do not reflect this retail release.	X	X
<seg id="29">	I have written to Amazon requesting they remove the old reviews; they have not yet done so.	X	X

<seg id="4">	Reviewed in the United States on August 27, 2012	X	X
<seg id="5">	Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring was a powerhouse of an ensemble film, featuring an all-star cast, fantastically detailed sets, an almost insane attention to detail, and gorgeous cinematography.	X	X
<seg id="6">	It's no wonder that while only released in 2001 it immediately vaulted to the #50 spot on the new AFI Top 100 listing, while other classics like Doctor Zhivago dropped off the list completely.	X	X
<seg id="7">	I should caveat first that I grew up reading and adoring the Lord of the Rings trilogy.	X	X
<seg id="8">	I re-read it probably once a year.	X	X
<seg id="9">	I absolutely adored Aragorn, and all of my daydreams were about me as Aragorn's loyal companion.	gender	companion=feminine
<seg id="10">	In the books, you see, Arwen hardly appears.	X	X
<seg id="11">	She's a footnote in an appendix.	X	X
<seg id="12">	This first book is all about men, men, and more men.	X	X
<seg id="13">	I suppose Galadriel shows up at one point, to pass around presents, but that's about it.	lexical ambiguity	at one point=at a certain place vs appears eventually
<seg id="14">	So when I went to see the film, it was almost a religious experience.	X	X
<seg id="15">	The Weathertop scene, where the hobbits are calling out "Strider" in panic, had me shiver.	X	X
<seg id="16">	These were my dreams coming to life.	X	X
<seg id="17">	The attention the WETA workshop put into every scene is legendary.	X	X
<seg id="18">	They literally had the book open and were reading the pages to know what to do.	reference	they=WETA  workshop
<seg id="19">	They hand carved proper Dwarvish ruins along all surfaces of the caves in the Mines of Moria.	X	X
<seg id="20">	Viggo learned to speak Elvish and lobbied for more dialogue in the language.	X	X
<seg id="21">	They tended to the gardens at Hobbiton for a full year so it had a "lived in" look.	X	X
<seg id="22">	Yes, they had to cut out some of the book.	lexical ambiguity	to cut out=to chop vs exclude
<seg id="23">	Heck, the movie was already 3 hours long!	X	X
<seg id="24">	I do not mind that at all.	X	X
<seg id="25">	And I also do not mind that they gave Arwen a part!	lexical ambiguity	a part=a slice or sections vs a role in the filme
<seg id="26">	Up until now we had ONE FEMALE.	X	X
<seg id="27">	That was it.	X	X
<seg id="28">	One.	gender	one = feminine
<seg id="29">	I realize the book was written in the "dark ages" of 1954 but still!	X	X
<seg id="30">	Surely there could be more females involved.	X	X
<seg id="31">	Even with the TWO whole females in the movie, they never even interact.	X	X
<seg id="32">	They are both there solely to be foils to the menfolk.	gender	they are both=feminine
<seg id="33">	Still, one cannot blame Jackson at all for that.	X	X
<seg id="34">	The responsibility for that goes back to J. R. R. Tolkien.	X	X
<seg id="35">	Some purists were already upset enough that Arwen got to speak in the movie :).	X	X
<seg id="36">	I imagine a hostile rage would have erupted if more than that occurred.	X	X
<seg id="37">	So absolutely I adore Lord of the Rings, and I own all the different versions on DVD.	X	X
<seg id="38">	I highly recommend watching it.	X	X
<seg id="39">	It is glorious in its own right, and so much of what it shows and says has infiltrated its way into modern culture.	X	X
<seg id="40">	Watching TV, reading novels, or going to movies can often involve an expectation that you "get" the references involved.	X	X

<seg id="6">	Woohoo for childhood trends that are still acceptable as adults!	X	X
<seg id="7">	Caves are fun to explore and can be very creepy, especially with lights out - they chose a great setting for this movie.	X	X
<seg id="8">	Some creatures do not want to be seen and will pursue you until you are dead when you trespass on their land and touch their things without their consent.	X	X
<seg id="9">	Will the group of women make it out alive?	X	X
<seg id="10">	Or do the cave creatures eat them all alive?	reference	them=women	gender	them=feminine   gender  alive=feminine
<seg id="11">	If ever caught in this situation, just remember cave creatures just want some peace and quiet and you are the ones who intruded on them.	X	X
<seg id="12">	Also, a good reminder that things that live in caves can venture outside of caves.	X	X
<seg id="13">	Some of the imagery is reminiscent of Norse Mythology and the mead of poetry.	X	X
<seg id="14">	This movie would have been a lot shorter had the ladies not taken picks.	lexical ambiguity	picks=choose / guitar picks vs take pickaxes
<seg id="15">	Good and fast-moving entertainment for the latter portion.	ellipsis	the latter portion of the film
<seg id="16">	Takes a little set-up to get going in the first portion.	ellipsis	the first portion of the filme

<seg id="5">	You see I am a lazy bum, and it was the first thing things to see in our to-do list for China (obviously).	reference	it=the great wall of china
<seg id="6">	Not just because of its reputation etc but I am also glad we did it when we had all the energy for it.	X	X
<seg id="7">	You go about 45-50 miles (I do not remember exactly what was the distance) off Beijing to do Mutianyu section.	X	X
<seg id="8">	We were a group of 4 friends and we took a cab for the whole day for RMB 1000 and we took approximately 2 hours or so to get there from Wangfujing.	X	X
<seg id="9">	We paid approx RMB 155 per person all inclusive i.e entrance fee plus bus ride to the cable car plus the cable car itself.	X	X
<seg id="10">	So it cost us RMB 405 per person from our hotel to visit the wall.	lexical ambiguity	wall=house wallls vs the china wall
<seg id="11">	Now about the wall itself.	lexical ambiguity	wall=house wallls vs the china wall
<seg id="12">	Mutianyu is the longest fully-restored Great Wall section open to tourists.	X	X
<seg id="13">	There are 23 watchtowers, about one every hundred meters on an ascending mountain ridge and I mean really they are STEEP no S***!	X	X
<seg id="14">	Pardon my language but damn most of us were tired in just covering 5 of those.	gender	those=feminine
<seg id="15">	Both sides of the wall have a crenellated parapet so that soldiers could fire arrows at enemy at both sides.	lexical ambiguity	wall=house wallls vs the china wall
<seg id="16">	This is very rare on other sections of wall.	lexical ambiguity	wall=house wallls vs the china wall
<seg id="17">	The Great Wall at Mutianyu is less crowded and has better architecture than at Badaling (we did not visit Badging but I am simply quoting what we read on various sites and many guides said), with more watchtowers.	X	X
<seg id="18">	The cable cars help you get to the wall (thank god for that).	lexical ambiguity	wall=house wallls vs the china wall
<seg id="19">	The cable car station is in the middle of the wall close to tower 14.	lexical ambiguity	wall=house wallls vs the china wall
<seg id="20">	We walked west from tower 14 to tower 23, and got to see the most beautiful scenery.	X	X
<seg id="21">	The path up goes to tower 8 or 10, which means you will need to walk an extra kilometer (half mile) on wall with comparatively plain scenery to get to the best part.	lexical ambiguity	wall=house wallls vs the china wall
<seg id="22">	There are about 4000+ steps at Mutianyu so be ready physically and mentally.	X	X
<seg id="23">	The steps are very uneven in many places, so mind your steps else you have a very nasty fall.	X	X
<seg id="24">	We went in mid Nov so take it from me, you are better off in good cross trainers than boots.	X	X
<seg id="25">	You will not feel cold after all that walking.	X	X
<seg id="26">	Most of us came back from the wall in just t-shirts despite the cold because we were sweating profusely.	lexical ambiguity	wall=house wallls vs the china wall
<seg id="27">	We arrived Mutianyu early afternoon when most morning tour groups had gone, which was great.	X	X
<seg id="28">	Oh and last but not the least there are a few restaurants at the place where you pay the fees etc before you start your ascend and also the same place you descend to grab a meal.	X	X
<seg id="29">	They had some pan cake places too so it does have more than just Chinese menu.	X	X
<seg id="30">	I highly recommend a visit to The Great Wall Mutianyu section in afternoon with those sturdy and comfortable pair of shoes, a big bottle of water, lot of time and energy and yes a good camera would be nice to try and capture the real beauty of this place.	X	X
