<seg id="2">	I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday 17 December 1999, and I would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period.	number	you=plural
<seg id="3">	Although, as you will have seen, the dreaded 'millennium bug' failed to materialise, still the people in a number of countries suffered a series of natural disasters that truly were dreadful.	number	you=plural	number	have seen=plural					
<seg id="4">	You have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days, during this part-session.	number	you=plural	number have requested=plural						
<seg id="5">	In the meantime, I should like to observe a minute' s silence, as a number of Members have requested, on behalf of all the victims concerned, particularly those of the terrible storms, in the various countries of the European Union.	X	X
<seg id="6">	Please rise, then, for this minute' s silence.	number	rise=plural
<seg id="7">	(The House rose and observed a minute's silence)	X	X
<seg id="8">	Madam President, on a point of order.	X	X
<seg id="9">	You will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in Sri Lanka.	gender	aware=feminine
<seg id="10">	One of the people assassinated very recently in Sri Lanka was Mr Kumar Ponnambalam, who had visited the European Parliament just a few months ago.	X	X
<seg id="11">	Would it be appropriate for you, Madam President, to write a letter to the Sri Lankan President expressing Parliament's regret at his and the other violent deaths in Sri Lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation?	gender	Sri Lank President=female
<seg id="12">	Yes, Mr Evans, I feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate.	X	X
<seg id="13">	If the House agrees, I shall do as Mr Evans has suggested.	X	X
<seg id="14">	Madam President, on a point of order.	X	X
<seg id="15">	I would like your advice about Rule 143 concerning inadmissibility.	X	X
<seg id="16">	My question relates to something that will come up on Thursday and which I will then raise again.	X	X
<seg id="17">	The Cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before Parliament on Thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph 6 that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually.	X	X
<seg id="18">	It says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability.	reference	it=the report
<seg id="19">	I believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible.	X	X
<seg id="20">	I want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report, not a legislative proposal, and whether that is something I can competently do on Thursday.	X	X
<seg id="21">	That is precisely the time when you may, if you wish, raise this question, i.e. on Thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report.	X	X
<seg id="22">	Madam President, coinciding with this year' s first part-session of the European Parliament, a date has been set, unfortunately for next Thursday, in Texas in America, for the execution of a young 34 year-old man who has been sentenced to death. 	X	X
<seg id="23">	We shall call him Mr Hicks.	X	X
<seg id="24">	At the request of a French Member, Mr Zimeray, a petition has already been presented, which many people signed, including myself. 	X	X
<seg id="25">	However, I would ask you, in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the European Parliament and by the whole of the European Community, to make representations, using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent, to the President and to the Governor of Texas, Mr Bush, who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person.	X	X
<seg id="26">	This is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld.	X	X
<seg id="27">	Thank you, Mr Segni, I shall do so gladly.	gender	thank you=feminine
<seg id="28">	Indeed, it is quite in keeping with the positions this House has always adopted.	X	X
<seg id="29">	Madam President, I should like to draw your attention to a case in which this Parliament has consistently shown an interest.	X	X
<seg id="30">	It is the case of Alexander Nikitin.	X	X
<seg id="31">	All of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in Russia, too, access to environmental information is a constitutional right.	X	X
<seg id="32">	Now, however, he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing.	X	X
<seg id="33">	We know, and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed, including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year, that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for Alexander Nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings.	lexical ambiguity	resolution= finding/observaton vs decision
<seg id="34">	These findings form the basis of the European programmes to protect the Barents Sea, and that is why I would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make Parliament's position, as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted, clear as far as Russia is concerned.	gender	you=feminine
<seg id="35">	Yes, Mrs Schroedter, I shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when I have received your letter.	gender	pleased=feminine
<seg id="36">	Madam President, I would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that, during this first part-session of the new year, the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably.	X	X
<seg id="37">	But, Madam President, my personal request has not been met.	X	X
<seg id="38">	Although there are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese one, there is still no Dutch channel, which is what I had requested because Dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month.	X	X
<seg id="39">	I would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a Dutch channel as well.	gender	you=feminine
<seg id="40">	Mrs Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the Quaestors' meeting on Wednesday.	X	X
<seg id="41">	It will, I hope, be examined in a positive light.	reference	it=this matter	lexical ambiguity	light  glare vs manner					
<seg id="42">	Madam President, can you tell me why this Parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes?	X	X
<seg id="43">	Why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected?	X	X
<seg id="44">	Why has there been no Health and Safety Committee meeting since 1998?	X	X
<seg id="45">	Why has there been no fire drill, either in the Brussels Parliament buildings or the Strasbourg Parliament buildings?	X	X
<seg id="46">	Why are there no fire instructions?	X	X
<seg id="47">	Why have the staircases not been improved since my accident?	X	X
<seg id="48">	Why are no-smoking areas not enforced?	X	X
<seg id="49">	It seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves.	X	X
<seg id="50">	Mrs Lynne, you are quite right and I shall check whether this has actually not been done.	X	X
<seg id="51">	I shall also refer the matter to the College of Quaestors, and I am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on.	gender	certain=feminine
<seg id="52">	Madam President, Mrs Díez González and I had tabled questions on certain opinions of the Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, which appeared in a Spanish newspaper.	X	X
<seg id="53">	The competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session.	reference	they=questions	gender	they=feminine					
<seg id="54">	I would ask that they reconsider, since this is not the case.	reference	they=the competente services gender	they=masculine						
<seg id="55">	The questions answered previously referred to Mrs de Palacio' s intervention, on another occasion, and not to these comments which appeared in the ABC newspaper on 18 November.	X	X
<seg id="56">	Mr Berenguer Fuster, we shall check all this.	X	X
<seg id="57">	I admit that, at present, the issue seems to be somewhat confused.	X	X
<seg id="58">	We shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be.	reference	it=issue gender	it=feminine						
<seg id="59">	Madam President, I should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from Parliament this week about our discontent over today's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on Indonesia, considering that the vast majority in this Parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in Indonesia in the past?	X	X
<seg id="60">	Today's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there.	X	X
<seg id="61">	So Parliament should send a message, since that is the wish of the vast majority.	X	X
<seg id="62">	It is irresponsible of EU Member States to refuse to renew the embargo.	X	X
<seg id="63">	As people have said, the situation there is extremely volatile.	X	X
<seg id="64">	There is, in fact, a risk of a military coup in the future.	X	X
<seg id="65">	We do not know what is happening.	X	X
<seg id="66">	So why should EU arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people?	X	X
<seg id="67">	In any event, this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on Thursday.	X	X
<seg id="68">	Agenda	X	X
<seg id="69">	The next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the Conference of Presidents at its meeting of 13 January pursuant to Rule 110 of the Rules of Procedure.	X	X
<seg id="70">	No amendments have been proposed relating to Monday and Tuesday.	X	X
<seg id="71">	Relating to Wednesday:	X	X
<seg id="72">	The Group of the Party of European Socialists requests that a Commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the Commission.	X	X
<seg id="73">	I would like Mr Barón Crespo, who made the request, to speak to propose it.	X	X
<seg id="74">	That is, if he so wishes, of course.	X	X
<seg id="75">	Then we shall follow the usual procedure, hearing one speaker in favour and one against.	X	X
<seg id="76">	Madam President, the presentation of the Prodi Commission' s political programme for the whole legislature was initially a proposal by the Group of the Party of European Socialists which was unanimously approved by the Conference of Presidents in September and which was also explicitly accepted by President Prodi, who reiterated his commitment in his inaugural speech.	X	X
<seg id="77">	This commitment is important because the Commission is a body with a monopoly of initiative in accordance with the Treaties and, therefore, basically dictates this Parliament' s political and legislative activity for the next five years.	X	X
<seg id="78">	I would also like to point out, Madam President, that this Parliament voted to express its confidence in President Prodi during the previous legislature.	X	X
<seg id="79">	It did so again during this legislature, in July, and then, in September, it voted once more to approve the whole Commission.	reference it=the parliament	ellipsis	did so=voted	reference	it=the parliament				
<seg id="80">	There has therefore been enough time for the Commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens.	X	X
<seg id="81">	To this end, I would like to remind you of the resolution of 15 September, which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible.	X	X
<seg id="82">	The events of last week - which originated outside the Conference of Presidents, that Conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere - present us with a dilemma.	X	X
<seg id="83">	Either the Commission is not ready to present this programme, in which case it should clarify it.	X	X
<seg id="84">	According to its President, it is in a position to do so.	gender	its president=feminine	reference	it=the commision					
<seg id="85">	Given that the Commission is represented by Vice-President de Palacio, I believe that, before voting, it would help if the Commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme, as agreed.	X	X
<seg id="86">	Alternatively, Parliament is not ready to examine this programme, as some appear to be suggesting.	X	X
<seg id="87">	In my opinion, this second hypothesis would imply the failure of Parliament in its duty as a Parliament, as well as introducing an original thesis, an unknown method which consists of making political groups aware, in writing, of a speech concerning the Commission' s programme a week earlier - and not a day earlier, as had been agreed - bearing in mind that the legislative programme will be discussed in February, so we could forego the debate, since on the next day our citizens will hear about it in the press and on the Internet and Parliament will no longer have to worry about it.	X	X
<seg id="88">	My Group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen, debate and reflect, there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that, if the Commission is ready to do so, we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between Parliament and the Commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens.	X	X
<seg id="89">	Therefore, the proposal of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, and which you have mentioned, is that the Prodi Commission present its legislative programme on Wednesday, including its proposed administrative reform, because, otherwise, we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation: on the pretext that there is no text, on the one hand, the President of the Commission would be denied his right to speak in this Parliament and, on the other hand, there would be a debate on a reform when Parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based.	X	X
<seg id="90">	Therefore, Madam President, I would ask you to request that the Commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote.	X	X
<seg id="91">	(Applause from the PSE Group)	X	X
<seg id="92">	Madam President, I really am quite astonished at Mr Barón Crespo' s behaviour and the fact that he is now asking for this item to be put on Wednesday's agenda.	X	X
<seg id="93">	Mr Barón Crespo, you were unable to attend the Conference of Presidents last Thursday.	X	X
<seg id="94">	I am not criticising this; it happens from time to time that people send someone to represent them.	X	X
<seg id="95">	Mr Hänsch represented you on this occasion.	X	X
<seg id="96">	In the Conference of Presidents, we had an in-depth discussion.	X	X
<seg id="97">	Your Group was alone in advocating what you are saying now.	X	X
<seg id="98">	We then put it to a vote.	reference	it=this item
<seg id="99">	As you know, each chairman has the same number of votes as his Group has Members.	X	X
<seg id="100">	There was a vote on this matter.	X	X
<seg id="101">	As I recall, the outcome of this vote was 422 votes to 180 with a few abstentions.	X	X
<seg id="102">	This means that all the Groups with the exception of the non-attached Members - but, of course, they are not a Group - were in agreement; only your Group thought that we should proceed as you have proposed here.	X	X
<seg id="103">	All of the others were of a different opinion.	X	X
<seg id="104">	That was the decision.	X	X
<seg id="105">	I should now like to comment on the issue itself.	X	X
<seg id="106">	We have confidence in the Commission and in Romano Prodi and, after a difficult procedure, as everyone knows, the vast majority of our Group supported the vote of confidence in Romano Prodi and the Commission.	X	X
<seg id="107">	We believe, however, that the Commission's strategic plan needs to be debated within a proper procedural framework, not only on the basis of an oral statement here in the European Parliament, but also on the basis of a document which is adopted in the Commission and which describes this programme over the five-year period.	X	X
<seg id="108">	There is no such document!	X	X
<seg id="109">	The Commission will present its programme for the year 2000 in February.	X	X
<seg id="110">	We have said, very well, if the Commission does not wish to introduce the 2000 programme as early as January then we will do it in February.	reference	it=the programme
<seg id="111">	We have agreed to this.	X	X
<seg id="112">	After all, we do not wish to quarrel with the Commission; if at all possible, we believe that the Commission and Parliament need to tread the same path.	X	X
<seg id="113">	However, we in Parliament also have a supervisory role with regard to the Commission and we do not have to agree with everything which comes out of the Commission.	X	X
<seg id="114">	I should like us to be able to do a reasonable amount of preparation for the debate on the five-year programme in our Groups.	X	X
<seg id="115">	You cannot prepare if you hear a statement in this House and have no idea of its content.	X	X
<seg id="116">	That is why we would recommend - and it is my impression that the Commission is also open to this idea - that we hold the debate on the Commission's long-term programme up to the year 2005 in February - and I hope that the Commission will agree on a programme before then which it will propose to us - and that, at the same time, in February we also hold the debate on the Commission's legislative programme for the year 2000.	X	X
<seg id="117">	The fact that the subjects are connected also suggests that we should hold the debate on both programmes together.	lexical ambiguity	subjects= issue/matter vs disciplines
<seg id="118">	That is why my Group firmly rejects the proposal made by the Socialist Group.	X	X
<seg id="119">	(Applause from the PPE-DE Group)	X	X
<seg id="120">	Madam President, I would like to make it very clear that, above all, the Commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this Parliament and, amongst those, the decision establishing its agenda.	X	X
<seg id="123">	We therefore respect whatever Parliament may decide.	X	X
<seg id="121">	But I would also like to make it very clear that President Prodi made a commitment to this Parliament to introduce a new debate, as Mr Barón Crespo has reminded us, which would be in addition to the annual debate on the Commission' s legislative programme, on the broad areas of action for the next five years, that is to say, for this legislature.	X	X
<seg id="122">	Madam President, I would like to say that the agreement reached in September distinguished this debate from the annual presentation of the Commission' s legislative programme.	X	X
<seg id="124">	I would also like to say that the Commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally, on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups.	X	X
<seg id="125">	Therefore, Madam President, I would like to repeat that the Commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and, when Parliament decides, - this week if that is the decision - we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and, next month, the programme for 2000, which is what we fully agreed upon.	X	X
<seg id="126">	I propose that we vote on the request of the Group of the Party of European Socialists that the Commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated.	X	X
<seg id="127">	(Parliament rejected the request)	X	X
<seg id="128">	President.	gender	president=feminine
<seg id="129">	Still on the subject of Wednesday' s sitting, I have another proposal regarding the oral question on capital tax.	X	X
<seg id="130">	The PPE-DE Group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda.	X	X
<seg id="131">	Is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this Group to propose this?	X	X
<seg id="132">	Madam President, I can hear a ripple of laughter from the Socialists.	X	X
<seg id="133">	I was told that large sections of the Socialist Group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda, because at the vote in the Conference of Presidents no vote was received from the working group of Members of the Socialist Group responsible for this matter.	X	X
<seg id="134">	I do not know whether this information is correct, but the PPE-DE Group would, in any case, be grateful if this item were removed because Parliament has addressed this issue several times already.	X	X
<seg id="135">	Decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind.	X	X
<seg id="136">	That is why my Group moves that this item be taken off the agenda.	X	X
<seg id="137">	Thank you, Mr Poettering.	gender	thank you=feminine
<seg id="138">	We shall now hear Mr Wurtz speaking against this request.	X	X
<seg id="139">	Madam President, I would firstly like to point out Mr Poettering' s lack of logic.	X	X
<seg id="140">	He has just been preaching to the Group of the Party of European Socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the Conference of Presidents, and now he is doing just the same.	X	X
<seg id="141">	We discussed that matter and we were unanimous, with the exception of the PPE and ELDR Groups.	X	X
<seg id="142">	As my fellow chairmen will recall, I even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the Tobin tax, but of whether one dared to hear what the Commission and the Council thought of it.	X	X
<seg id="143">	It is not a lot to ask.	X	X
<seg id="144">	I therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the Commission and the Council should be retained so that we can find out, once and for all, the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion, particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the Seattle Conference.	X	X
<seg id="145">	We shall proceed to vote on the PPE-DE Group' s request that the oral question regarding the capital tax be withdrawn from the agenda.	X	X
<seg id="146">	(Parliament rejected the request, with 164 votes for, 166 votes against and 7 abstentions)	X	X
<seg id="147">	Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for advertising this debate.	X	X
<seg id="148">	Thank you very much.	X	X
<seg id="149">	Madam President, has my vote been counted?	X	X
<seg id="150">	I was unable to vote electronically, since I do not have a card.	X	X
<seg id="151">	My vote was "in favour" .	X	X
<seg id="152">	Indeed, if we add the two Members who have declared themselves, then the result of the vote would be ....	X	X
<seg id="153">	Madam President, the Presidency has already declared the result of the vote.	X	X
<seg id="154">	There is no room for amendments.	X	X
<seg id="155">	Ladies and gentlemen, once again, we see it is essential for Members to bring their voting cards along on a Monday.	X	X
<seg id="156">	Clearly there is a problem here.	X	X
<seg id="157">	That being the case, I shall have to make a decision.	X	X
<seg id="158">	I too forgot my card, and I would have voted against.	X	X
<seg id="159">	I therefore consider that the oral question may be kept on the agenda as per the vote.	X	X
<seg id="160">	This is the last time that we shall make allowances for Members who have forgotten their cards.	X	X
<seg id="161">	Let that be clearly noted and understood.	X	X
<seg id="162">	(Applause)	X	X
<seg id="163">	The oral question will therefore remain on the agenda, and yes, your President is entitled to vote just as she is entitled to forget her voting card.	X	X
<seg id="164">	We shall continue with the other amendments to the agenda.	X	X
<seg id="165">	Madam President, in the earlier vote - and I will abide by your ruling on this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the Commission I indicated that I would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my Group.	X	X
<seg id="166">	That did not happen.	X	X
<seg id="167">	I would appreciate it if, on the close of this item of business, I might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my Group.	X	X
<seg id="168">	This is an important matter.	X	X
<seg id="169">	It would be useful for the record of the House to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis.	X	X
<seg id="170">	Madam President, I do not wish to reopen the debate, but I had also asked for the floor, to comment on Mr Barón Crespo's motion.	X	X
<seg id="171">	You did not call me either.	X	X
<seg id="172">	I regret this, but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there.	X	X
<seg id="173">	I am terribly sorry, Mr Hänsch and Mr Cox.	gender	sorry=feminine
<seg id="174">	I  did not see you asking to speak.	X	X
<seg id="175">	Even so, I think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the Minutes.	X	X
<seg id="176">	When we adopt the Minutes for today' s sitting tomorrow, then any Members who think the positions have not been explained clearly enough may ask for amendments.	X	X
<seg id="177">	This seems to me to be a workable solution.	X	X
<seg id="178">	Of course, the Minutes for tomorrow' s sitting will take into account any additional explanations.	X	X
<seg id="179">	I think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time-consuming explanations of votes.	X	X
<seg id="180">	Mr Cox, Mr Hänsch, would this be acceptable to you?	X	X
<seg id="181">	Madam President, if the vote records correctly how my Group voted I shall not, and cannot, object to that.	X	X
<seg id="182">	If your ruling is that I cannot give an explanation of vote, I accept that but with reservations.	X	X
<seg id="183">	We shall pay particular attention to the wording of the Minutes, as we always do, of course.	X	X
<seg id="184">	If they do not properly reflect the positions adopted, then we may correct them, if necessary.	X	X
<seg id="185">	(The order of business was adopted thus amended)	X	X
<seg id="186">	Safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods	X	X
<seg id="187">	The next item is the report (A5-0105/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to adopting a European Parliament and Council directive on the harmonisation of examination requirements for safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterways (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106(COD)).	X	X
<seg id="188">	Commissioner, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I can be quite frank in saying that I welcome the Council's common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.	X	X
<seg id="189">	Firstly, we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC, which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training, instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly.	X	X
<seg id="190">	Secondly, by adopting this directive we achieve a) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped; b) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market.	X	X
<seg id="191">	Thirdly, this directive, as it currently stands in the common position, guarantees - in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards - a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States' bearing a high level of individual responsibility.	X	X
<seg id="192">	All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed.	X	X
<seg id="193">	Our amendments from the first reading have, I believe, been taken into account very satisfactorily.	X	X
<seg id="194">	They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance, or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included, for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions.	reference they=our amendements	gender	they=feminine	gender	accepted=feminine	gender	transported=feminine	gender	rejected= feminine
<seg id="195">	The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive, is something which I would urge you to support.	X	X
<seg id="196">	By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force, we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay.	X	X
<seg id="197">	I would urge you to endorse this.	X	X
<seg id="198">	Madam President, we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads, but also on our railways and waterways, not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because - as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles - a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster.	X	X
<seg id="199">	As an Austrian, I still have a vivid memory, as, I believe, we all do, of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel, where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense.	X	X
<seg id="200">	The renovation project, which lasted for months, cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe.	X	X
<seg id="201">	The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit.	X	X
<seg id="202">	In fact, all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province.	X	X
<seg id="203">	Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available, so that the right action is taken in good time.	X	X
<seg id="204">	All the same, we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety.	X	X
<seg id="205">	We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and - even more importantly - we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards.	X	X
<seg id="206">	Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.	X	X
<seg id="207">	I should like to address one final point.	X	X
<seg id="208">	We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that, where transport safety in Europe is concerned, there is still much more to be done.	X	X
<seg id="209">	In this context, I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible, who is with us here today, to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future, so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale.	X	X
<seg id="210">	Madam President, first of all I should like to thank Mr Koch for his report which has, at its heart, the issue of transport safety.	X	X
<seg id="211">	The report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway.	X	X
<seg id="212">	I congratulate him on his excellent report.	X	X
<seg id="213">	Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently: the Paddington rail crash in London, the terrible rail crash in Norway, the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the Erika off Brittany - all within the last four months - remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.	X	X
<seg id="214">	The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament's other amendments has been retained.	X	X
<seg id="215">	My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible.	X	X
<seg id="216">	When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety.	X	X
<seg id="217">	We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved.	X	X
<seg id="218">	Madam President, I would like to make a few comments.	X	X
<seg id="219">	I would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and, secondly, the Commission for the proposal it has submitted.	X	X
<seg id="220">	We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also, in fact, with minimum requirements.	X	X
<seg id="221">	This is a pity, in a sense.	X	X
<seg id="222">	Needless to say, safety on roads, railways and inland waterways is of key importance and, given the international nature of these types of transport, training for safety advisors should also be harmonised, therefore, as well as the requirements of the new ADR, for example, which is under way.	X	X
<seg id="223">	This is important, but so is enforcement and there are, of course, a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this.	X	X
<seg id="224">	Just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years, for example in Belgium, the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead. Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here, with all the obvious risks that this entails.	X	X
<seg id="225">	Furthermore, it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan has shown that 50% of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment.	X	X
<seg id="226">	In short, the issue is an important one.	X	X
<seg id="227">	If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned, in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year.	X	X
<seg id="228">	There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present, especially with smaller companies, as these cannot afford safety advisors.	X	X
<seg id="229">	These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo, which causes problems.	X	X
<seg id="230">	It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.	X	X
<seg id="231">	The work is done.	X	X
<seg id="232">	All that remains is the business of enforcement.	X	X
<seg id="233">	I would like to mention one final point.	X	X
<seg id="234">	With regard to enforcement, proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001, that is to say in eighteen months' time.	X	X
<seg id="235">	This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period.	X	X
<seg id="236">	This is not in itself anything dreadful, but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate these, as part of the acquis communautaire, as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.	X	X
<seg id="237">	Madam President, the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this Parliament and rightly so.	X	X
<seg id="238">	The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks, known and unknown, for employees and the social environment.	X	X
<seg id="239">	Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements.	X	X
<seg id="240">	The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive, 95/35/EC, seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods.	X	X
<seg id="241">	I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding examinations, although I would have preferred it if uniform, set standards and modules had been established, so that certificates would be of equal value internationally.	X	X
<seg id="242">	This, however, does not seem feasible.	X	X
<seg id="243">	Finally, the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can, therefore, give it my wholehearted support.	X	X
<seg id="244">	Mr President, Commissioner, I should first like to congratulate Mr Koch on his reports which, though technical, are nonetheless of very great significance for safety.	X	X
<seg id="245">	I should like to make just a few comments.	X	X
<seg id="246">	Firstly, I should like to ask the Commissioner - and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground - to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety, be it on the roads, on the waterways or at sea.	X	X
<seg id="247">	Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998, even though Parliament responded relatively quickly, this time lag is a little too long.	X	X
<seg id="248">	This is not just the fault of the Commission, but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.	X	X
<seg id="249">	My second point has already been mentioned: it concerns the minimum standards.	X	X
<seg id="250">	In principle, I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules.	X	X
<seg id="251">	However, when it comes to safety, I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden, for example, is in principle no different from safety in Germany, Italy or Austria.	X	X
<seg id="252">	I can live with these minimum standards, but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully.	X	X
<seg id="253">	Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation.	X	X
<seg id="254">	My third point has also been mentioned already.	X	X
<seg id="255">	As you know, like Mr Rack, I come from a transit country, where this issue plays a particularly important role.	X	X
<seg id="256">	We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries.	X	X
<seg id="257">	But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not.	X	X
<seg id="258">	Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koch, on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway.	X	X
<seg id="259">	We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent.	X	X
<seg id="260">	The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.	X	X
<seg id="261">	Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission' s priorities in the field of transport.	X	X
<seg id="262">	As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end.	X	X
<seg id="263">	The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day.	X	X
<seg id="264">	In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety.	X	X
<seg id="265">	In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves.	X	X
<seg id="266">	Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster.	X	X
<seg id="267">	Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.	X	X
<seg id="268">	Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport.	X	X
<seg id="269">	This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport.	X	X
<seg id="270">	But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission.	X	X
<seg id="271">	As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.	X	X
<seg id="272">	I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch.	X	X
<seg id="273">	The debate is closed.	X	X
<seg id="274">	The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.	X	X
